H1: Prologue
P: 
P: 
P: After returning home alone from the Hime-Ragi household.
P: Charlotte and I finished dinner and bathing and sat close together on the sofa.
P: Emma had been taken to a hotel by Sophia, so she wasn't here.
P: Honestly, being caught French kissing by Hanane-san and Sophia-san was quite embarrassing, but it was a relief they let us go soon after.
P: Thanks to that, I avoided being teased.
P: 
P: "Shall we go to bed then...?"
P: 
P: Charlotte, her cheeks slightly flushed and her eyes filled with a warm glow, looked at me with a certain expectation in her gaze.
P: It looked as though she was expecting something.
P: "Yeah, let's head to the futon."
P: Still holding hands, I smiled at her.
P: The futon was already laid out, so when we went to the bedroom—
P: "Even though we're not married... since we're engaged, would this be our wedding night...?"
P: Charlotte dropped an outrageous bombshell.
P: No, the way she said it...!
P: I pressed my hand against my chest, which was pounding loudly, trying to keep my composure.
P: I couldn't let myself go with the flow as usual this time.
P: Christmas, and Charlotte's birthday, were just around the corner.
P: I wanted to make it an unforgettable memory and do it properly then.
P: "We're not newlyweds, so that's not it."
P: I barely managed to get those words out from my dry throat.
P: And then—
P: "............"
P: Charlotte looked visibly dejected.
P: Not only that, but she began to squeeze and rub my hand in silent appeal. It was both pitiful and terribly cute—but I resolutely held back, waiting for Christmas Eve.
H1: Chapter One　"The Beautiful Foreign Exchange Student Pleads"
P: 
P: 
P: 　The next Sunday after enduring Charlotte's silent appeal―― From the morning, Kanon-san and Kaguraya-san were present.
P: 　Additionally, Sophia-san and Emma-chan had also come over.
P: "Now then, let's start packing." 
P: 　With a cheerful and delighted smile, Kanon-san encouraged us to prepare for the move.
P: 　It seemed that we were already moving to the new residence the day after yesterday's events.
P: "Sophia and I need to tidy up the room next door, don’t we?" 
P: 　Of course, Sophia-san and Charlotte would be packing up their own rooms as well.
P: "Since Akihito has so few belongings as you can see, Kaguraya, please help your older sisters." 
P: 　Apparently, I had even fewer belongings than Charlotte, who had only been here for about three months since moving in.
P: 　They lived as a group of three, and occasionally packages addressed to Charlotte would arrive, so it made sense that she had more stuff.
P: 　The boxes contained things Charlotte bought as part of her hobbies, seemingly through online shopping.
P: 　She didn't go into detail, so I didn’t know exactly what she was buying.
P: "Um, how about we all pack Akihito-kun’s room first and then move on to our own rooms…?" 
P: 　When we were discussing splitting the tasks, Charlotte timidly raised her hand and made a suggestion.
P: 　It was a rare gesture for her.
P: "What are you talking about? There’s only so much we can do when packing, so having too many people will just get in the way." 
P: 　However, Sophia-san immediately rejected Charlotte’s proposal.
P: 　As a result, Charlotte looked dejected and began fiddling with the sleeve of my shirt with her fingers.
P: 　She might have wanted me to take her side—but to be honest, I thought Sophia-san was right this time.
P: "You don’t have to look so obviously downcast…" 
P: 　Seeing Charlotte’s behavior, Sophia-san scratched her cheek awkwardly with her finger.
P: "Charlotte-san, it’s only for a little while. Once we’re done, you can be with Akihito again." 
P: 　Kanon-san gently smiled as she patted Charlotte’s head.
P: 　Even though they were only a year apart, her calm demeanor made her seem like an older sister.
P: 　At least with Charlotte, she seemed to interact as if she were her elder sister, just like I did.
P: "I’ll be okay…" 
P: 　Despite saying that, Charlotte didn’t let go of my sleeve.
P: 　What was going on?
P: 　Even though we spent most of the day together, we naturally parted ways during things like bath time.
P: 　When Emma-chan was awake, she took priority, and when there were errands, we would also separate. So why was Charlotte so reluctant to part today?
P: 　While I was puzzled—.
P: "Onii-chan, wanna play?" 
P: 　Emma-chan tugged at the sleeve of my shirt, asking adorably while tilting her head.
P: 　But it wasn’t really a question—it was an invitation to play.
P: 　Maybe she wanted everyone, including Sophia-san, to join in and have fun.
P: "Sorry, we’re about to start preparing for the move." 
P: 　I crouched down and explained to Emma-chan.
P: 　I had assumed Sophia-san had explained before they arrived, but judging by her reaction, Emma-chan probably didn’t know about the move happening today.
P: "Moving?" 
P: "That’s right. Emma-chan, would you like to watch over the kitty?" 
P: 　For a child as young as Emma-chan, helping with the move would be too much, and having her wander around might be dangerous.
P: 　So I showed her my phone, but—.
P: "Emma wants to help Onii-chan…!" 
P: 　Apparently, Emma-chan wanted to help out too.
P: 　If she was eager to help, I thought it would be nice to let her try—.
P: "Then, could you help Charlotte and the others?" 
P: 　Since Emma-chan originally lived in the adjacent room and Charlotte and Sophia were heading there, I thought it best for her to go with them.
P: "No…! Emma wants to help Onii-chan…!" 
P: 　But Emma-chan seemed determined to help me instead.
P: 　She emphasized “Onii-chan,” so it seemed like that part was particularly important to her.
P: 　What should I do?
P: 　If Emma-chan stayed here, it might slow down progress since it would be just Kanon-san and me in this room.
P: 　Charlotte would likely take her along as well.
P: "Well then, let’s have Emma stay here after all…!" 
P: 『Huh?』
P: 　Contrary to my expectations, Charlotte seemed somehow pleased and respected Emma-chan’s decision.
P: 　It was unusual for her.
P: 　Normally, she would take Emma-chan along to avoid inconveniencing others.
P: 　Maybe it’s because I’m the one involved?
P: 「How obvious...」
P: 「Hehe, so straightforward and adorable.」
P: 　Seeing Charlotte’s demeanor, Sophia-san gave a wry smile, while Kanon-san smiled brightly.
P: 　Both of them seemed to have noticed something... but what?
P: 「Come on, let’s get moving. We’ll finish the move by the end of today.」
P: 　Since the tasks had been divided, Sophia-san pushed Charlotte’s back and left the room.
P: 「Make sure not to do anything weird.」
P: 　Kaguya-san gave me a sharp glare to emphasize her warning before following Sophia-san and the others out of the room.
P: 　Well, it’s only natural to ensure her master isn’t taken advantage of.
P: 　Of course, I had no intention of doing so.
P: 『Emma, what are you doing?』
P: 『Oh, could you put towels and clothes into the cardboard boxes? Kanon-san, could you help her?』
P: 　Although it was my task, it wasn’t necessary for me to do it together with them.
P: 　It would be better for the two of them to handle the lighter items, while I focused on the heavier ones.
P: 『Yes, of course. Emma-chan, let’s do it together, okay?』
P: 『Mmm...!』
P: 　Perhaps because of Kanon-san’s gentle aura, or maybe because they had interacted while at the Himehiragi household, Emma-chan didn’t seem to dislike her.
P: 　Thanks to that, I could leave it to them with peace of mind.
P: 「Akihito.」
P: 「Yes?」
P: 　While I was assembling a cardboard box, Kanon-san called out to me.
P: 　Then, leaning close to my ear, she whispered in a sultry voice.
P: 「Actually, we’re keeping this room for a while longer.」
P: 「What...!?」
P: 　Surprised, I looked at her, and Kanon-san was smiling brightly, clearly enjoying herself.
P: 　Normally, one might think it’s simply to allow for a smoother transition during the move.
P: 　But that voice just now...
P: 「So, let’s leave some towels and clothes here. The other house already has furniture and essentials, so we only need to bring the bare minimum. This way, Akihito and Charlotte can use this room whenever you want.」
P: 　As expected, she was suggesting we use this house whenever Charlotte and I wanted to be alone.
P: 「You really didn’t need to go that far...」
P: 「This is as much for Charlotte-san as it is for you, Akihito. She may want to depend on you without worrying about others watching.」
P: 　Up until now, it had just been me, Charlotte, and Emma-chan living together, so we only needed to wait for Emma-chan to fall asleep.
P: 　But from now on, with Sophia-san, Kanon-san, and Kaguya-san living with us, things would naturally be different.
P: 　Even if we went back to our room, the presence of Kanon-san and the others couldn’t be ignored.
P: 　It wouldn’t be easy to relax and be affectionate in such a situation.
P: 「Aren’t you spoiling us a bit too much?」
P: 「As your older sister, it’s only natural for me to spoil you.」
P: 　Though it felt a bit overprotective, it wasn’t new—she had always been extraordinary.
P: 「Charlotte-san really is adorable. Even from a distance, it’s clear how much she wants to lean on you, Akihito.」
P: 「Haha... well, she’s a straightforward girl. But as her boyfriend, it’s very fulfilling.」
P: 　Despite being a bit self-inflicted, for someone like me who had lived hated by others, being so wanted made me incredibly happy.
P: 　Feeling her love for me made me feel truly blessed.
P: 「Hehe... you both care deeply for each other. You’re both clever, so I’m not worried about you making any mistakes. It’s reassuring to watch.」
P: 　Kanon-san spoke with satisfaction and turned her gaze to Emma-chan.
P: 『Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we carry the towels now?』
P: 『Mmm...!』
P: 　Emma-chan, who had been quietly watching us, nodded happily when Kanon-san spoke to her.
P: 　Even though she couldn’t understand Japanese, she must have waited patiently because I was speaking with Kanon-san, not Charlotte.
P: 　She had a good reputation at daycare, and it seemed her listening skills improved when dealing with people outside her close circle.
P: 　Emma-chan imitated Kanon-san and started packing towels and clothes into the cardboard box.
P: 　Since she had volunteered herself, she worked diligently.
P: 　The result was—
P: 『Zzz... zzz...』
P: 　By the time the packing was done, I was so tired that I fell asleep.
P: 　Although there wasn’t much to pack for the move, it didn’t take too long, but the unfamiliar task must have worn me out.
P: 　Now, Emma is sleeping peacefully, resting her head on Kanon’s lap.
P: “Hehe... She truly looks as adorable as an angel.”
P: 　Being fond of children, Kanon happily stroked Emma’s head.
P: “Emma-chan was the one who gave me and Charlotte the push we needed to get closer.”
P: 　Though Kanon and the others were pulling the strings behind the scenes, if it weren’t for Emma, Charlotte and I probably wouldn’t have become as close as we are now.
P: 　At the very least, we wouldn’t have developed a relationship close enough to start dating.
P: 　Our relationship began when I helped Emma, who had gotten lost.
P: “Are you perhaps comparing her to an angel and Cupid?”
P: “Yes, I understand they’re different, but they look similar.”
P: 　As I recall, angels are messengers of God, while Cupid is the Roman god of love.
P: 　While they are distinctly different beings, their depictions often look very similar.
P: 　The main difference is whether or not they’re holding a bow and arrow, isn’t it?
P: “Hehe, Emma-chan is indeed your Cupid, Akihito.”
P: 　Kanon seemed to be thinking the same thing as me and smiled warmly.
P: “Well, you and the others were pulling the strings behind the scenes, though.”
P: “How mean of you to say that. That’s supposed to be our little secret.”
P: 　For Kanon, it was rare for her to give a sharp look like that.
P: 　I don’t recall ever making such a promise, but it’s probably an unspoken agreement of sorts.
P: “Of course, I’m grateful for it.”
P: 　Even if it was orchestrated, I’m genuinely happy to be dating someone as kind and sweet as Charlotte.
P: 　Under normal circumstances, she would have been out of my league, even if I had tried to reach for her.
P: “I also think it’s wonderful that Charlotte became the girlfriend of my dear brother. Beyond being the daughter of our esteemed elder sister, she is graceful, kind, and, most importantly, someone who puts Akihito first.”
P: “Could it be that you already knew about Charlotte?”
P: 　Judging by her tone, I got that impression.
P: “I knew of her existence, but our elder sister seemed reluctant to involve Charlotte in our world, so she didn’t bring her to any gatherings. I only knew about her through what our elder sister told me.”
P: 　Even Charlotte herself hadn’t known that her mother was the president of the company.
P: 　Perhaps she wanted to avoid drawing attention for political marriages or exposing her to the unsavory side of adults.
P: 　Kanon likely learned about her because their daughters were close in age, allowing her to open up more.
P: “Charlotte is pure, for better or worse.”
P: 　She’s a smart girl, but that doesn’t mean she’s immune to being deceived by lies.
P: 　If anything, she might even lend a hand if someone pretended to be in trouble.
P: 　That’s just how kind she is.
P: 　But in the world Kanon and Sophia lived in, such kindness could be a fatal flaw.
P: 　Kindness doesn’t always translate to a strength in every situation.
P: “That’s why you’re here, Akihito. You must protect Charlotte no matter what.”
P: 　It’s a boyfriend’s role to protect his girlfriend.
P: 　—Though it’s probably not as simple as that.
P: 　What Sophia and Kanon expect from me isn’t just to protect Charlotte physically.
P: 　I think I have an idea of what they want from me.
P: “I’m determined to protect Charlotte no matter what.”
P: “Our elder sister entrusted Charlotte to you because she believes you have the ability to protect her. And of course, I trust you have that ability too.”
P: “I’ll do my best not to betray that trust.”
P: 　I need to study and learn a lot more.
P: 　So that I can be of help to Charlotte in the future.
P: “Yes, I’m counting on you. I’m sure Charlotte places her trust in you more than anyone else.”
P: 　Kanon narrowed her eyes and gazed at me with a gentle look.
P: 　Being stared at like that directly made me feel rather embarrassed.
P: “I’d be happy if that’s the case.”
P: “Judging by how dependent Charlotte is on you, there’s no doubt about it.”
P: 　Dependent… That’s a pretty straightforward way to put it.
P: 　Well, I do feel it’s true, though...
P: "Her jealousy and depth of love—Akihito, you can handle them effortlessly, can't you?"
P: Kaname-san said such an outrageous thing with a bright smile.
P: It seemed she had also noticed Charlotte's jealousy.
P: "When you put it that way, I'm not sure I have the composure to nod confidently… but I've never once thought it was unpleasant."
P: It only made me realize how much Charlotte loved me.
P: In fact, it made me happy.
P: Of course, if it ever escalated to harming someone, I couldn't just be happy about it—but gentle Charlotte would never do such a thing.
P: For now, the more jealous she gets, the more affectionate she becomes.
P: "Please take good care of her. Akihito, you are irreplaceable to Charlotte."
P: "Because I'm her boyfriend, right?"
P: "That's not it."
P: Kaname-san chuckled softly, as if to say, "What can I do with you?" and spoke again with a kind expression.
P: "To her, Akihito is the only one who helped her repeatedly when she was struggling and healed the wounds in her heart. After her father’s situation, she forced herself to act like an adult and couldn’t rely on anyone… It's natural that she doesn’t want to lose someone who indulges her like that."
P: Just as Kaname-san said, Charlotte had been trying hard to act as a father figure for Emma.
P: Because of that, she had to behave like an adult, and she could no longer lean on Sophia-san either due to guilt.
P: She’s inherently someone who craves affection, so I think she must have always wanted someone to rely on.
P: Her dependence on me is probably a sign that I became the person she had been seeking.
P: "I'm happy as long as I can be someone Charlotte needs."
P: "Hehe, that's for certain. If Akihito disappeared, Charlotte would probably be bedridden."
P: I’m not sure if she'd go that far, but I do think she'd be pretty upset.
P: "I trust you, Akihito, but please don’t do anything that would hurt Charlotte over a tangled love affair, okay?"
P: "Haha, that’s impossible. I’m not popular anyway."
P: Dating someone as amazing as Charlotte, I would never look at anyone else, nor do I ever get approached.
P: Charlotte, on the other hand, is very popular, but she’s not the kind of person to cheat, so there’s no need to worry.
P: —Or so I thought...
P: "…………"
P: I found myself being looked at with an expression as if I was some hopeless person.
P: Did I say something wrong…?
P: "Kaname-san…?"
P: "Your obliviousness is truly frightening."
P: "Huh?"
P: "It's nothing."
P: Kaname-san smiled brightly, brushing it off.
P: She looked like she had some thoughts on the matter, though…?
P: "—Akihito…" 
P: "Huh? Charlotte, what’s wrong!?"
P: When I turned around upon hearing my name, Charlotte was standing there, red-faced and teary-eyed.
P: What on earth happened over there…?
P: "She’s just embarrassed because she got caught hiding a bunch of thin books."
P: Behind her, Sophia-san appeared with an exasperated look.
P: Thin books… she must mean doujinshi.
P: They were probably the ones Charlotte occasionally ordered online.
P: Charlotte does seem to have a lot of knowledge in that area...
P: I might need to study too, or she might be disappointed in me when the time comes…
P: "You didn’t have to tell Akihito that…!"
P: Charlotte, who rarely showed anger, seemed genuinely upset about this one.
P: "If I didn’t explain, it would’ve caused misunderstandings. Besides, didn’t you agree not to keep secrets?"
P: Sophia-san referred to the promise Charlotte and I made yesterday.
P: We did agree not to keep secrets—but I wouldn’t complain if she kept her hobbies private.
P: Especially if it’s something that would embarrass her if found out.
P: "Ugh… Akihito, mom is being mean to me…!"
P: Sharl jumped into my arms, apparently thinking I couldn't say anything back.
P: It was like Emma was reacting to Sharl scolding her
P: As expected from sisters, Sharl and Emma were very similar.
P: “There, there, don't worry. I'll accept anything you like, Sharl.”
P: Sharl, who had good ears, could clearly hear it.
P: My face is pressed against my chest while writhing in agony, so it tickles a little.
P: “Isn't that fine? You're at that age.”
P: Just like me, Kanon-san affirmed Sharl with a smile.
P: In this person's case, they usually forgive me, so they probably don't mind.
P: ———Or so I thought… but for some reason, Kanon-san started beckoning to Kaguraya-san.
P: As Kaguraya-san approached, she brought her mouth close to her ear as if talking in secret—
P: “So, what do you like about her?”
P: ——Sneakily, I asked something.
P: “Milady, you don't have any resistance to that sort of thing, do you?”
P: Kaguraya-san sighed helplessly.
P: It feels like it's been a while since I've seen you act that way around Kanon-san.
P: It seemed the two of them were still talking in private.
P: “I'm of age, after all——That's just a joke, so I have to know what my sister likes. What do you think?”
P: “There were a lot of situations, but most of them were forced on herbivore boys——”
P: “——G-Geez, please forgive me……!”
P: It seemed like it was something Sharl really wanted to stop, and she blushed bright red and wept as she begged to.
P: After being found out, Sophia would have retorted a lot in the room next door, and cornering her any further would probably be terribly.
P: “Let's not delve any deeper into Sharl's hobby. No matter what she likes, she's free to do as she pleases.”
P: I thought Sharl might be worried if I said doujinshi, so I replaced it with a hobby and stopped Kanon-san and the others.
P: Kanon-san and the others looked at Sharl apologetically, as if they thought their pranks had gone too far.
P: “I'm sorry, Charlotte-san. As Akihito said, no matter what kind of hobby Charlotte has, it's up to her, so please don't worry about it.”
P: “Sniff……”
P: Sharl probably wasn't as easily divided as Kanon-san put it into words.
P: This time, she pressed her cheeks against my cheeks.
P: And then she rubbed it against me as if fawning over me.
P: “Okay, okay, I'm fine.”
P: I gently patted Sharl's head again, then patted her head.
P: At this point, I have no choice but to thoroughly spoil her.
P: Otherwise, Sharl’s wounded heart wouldn’t heal.
P: “.........”
P: Sophia has a complicated expression.
P: Since her daughter had her hands on a book aimed at adults, she must be troubled as a parent.
P: 
P: ...But if I remember correctly, Charlotte said that when she shops online, she uses a credit card given to her by Sophia-san rather than cash on delivery.
P: Looking at the credit card statement, it should be clear that she buys a lot from specialty stores, but perhaps they didn't check exactly what Charlotte was buying.
P: "Well, even if you buy things... do it in moderation."
P: In the end, it seems Sophia-san forgave her.
P: Moderation, huh... just how much did she actually buy?
P: I'm curious, but I can't bring myself to ask in this situation.
P: "A-kun..."
P: "Yeah, don't worry. No one's blaming you."
P: In front of her elder sister figure and her mother, I continued to pamper the cute girl who was tearfully seeking comfort.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "...So this is the new house?"
P: The new house wasn't far from where we used to live.
P: In fact, it was within walking distance.
P: But the house was much larger than I had imagined.
P: It wasn't exactly a mansion, but it was a two-story detached house.
P: "The rooms are spacious too. First, let's go to Akihito and Charlotte-san's room."
P: Kanon-san guided us with a smile.
P: When we entered, the entrance and hallway were no different in size from an ordinary house.
P: The rooms, however, seemed much larger.
P: "...Did you knock down some walls?"
P: Compared to the other rooms, ours was exceptionally spacious, and its shape was slightly irregular, which made me think that.
P: A large bed called a king size, two wardrobes, and a large TV.
P: In addition, there was a bookshelf taller and wider than me, two study desks and chairs, as well as a sofa and cushions.
P: And even with a closet, there was still plenty of space left.
P: Incidentally, all the furniture seemed to be from luxury brands.
P: "As expected, you have a good eye. With this much space, you can flirt to your heart's content, can't you?"
P: "I don't think space has anything to do with it..."
P: I replied to Kanon-san, who was smiling brightly, with an awkward smile.
P: But Charlotte seemed to have interpreted it differently.
P: Her face turned bright red, and she pressed her cheeks with her hands, seemingly lost in her own thoughts.
P: What in the world is she imagining?
P: "Thanks to doujinshi, her imagination has become quite vivid..."
P: "Well, it's fine, isn't it? It's better for one of you to have knowledge than neither, right?"
P: Sophia-san sighed as she looked at Charlotte, but Kanon-san laughed and lightheartedly supported her.
P: What in the world are they talking about?
P: "I knew she loved Japanese culture and was a big fan of manga and anime, but when did she start getting into that kind of stuff?"
P: "I understand your concern as her mother, but I think there's no need to worry. In the end, it's Akihito who will be her partner, and he'll accept whatever Charlotte does."
P: Yeah, seriously, what are they talking about...?
P: Kanon-san gave me a warm look, which made me feel very curious.
P: "...You know what happens if you show any improper behavior in front of the young lady, right?"
P: And then Kaguraya-san, who had come up behind me, pressed something cold against my neck.
P: I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong here...
P: "I'll be careful..."
P: "Good."
P: Satisfied with my response, Kaguraya-san walked away.
P: Even though it’s decided that I'll join the Himehiiragi family after graduation, her attitude toward me hasn't changed.
P: I feel like it’ll stay this way forever.
P: "A-kun..."
P: Charlotte tugged on my sleeve.
P: When I looked at her, she gazed up at me with feverish eyes.
P: "What's wrong?"
P: I asked, holding my breath as I met her longing gaze.
P: I kind of had a sense of what she wanted, but...
P: "..."
P: Charlotte pressed her face against my arm.
P: She probably got carried away with her earlier imagination and switched into a clingy mode.
P: "...Akihito, we'll go check out the other rooms, so take your time here. The luggage hasn't arrived yet anyway."
P: Kanon-san spoke gently, smiling as she noticed Charlotte's state and decided to leave us alone.
P: It seemed the Himehiiragi family's butlers would be delivering the moving items, but they were intentionally taking their time.
P: I was grateful for their thoughtfulness in every way.
P: "Well then, Akihito-kun, Lottie. See you later."
P: Sophia-san also left with a smile, carrying a sleeping Emma in her arms.
P: Of course, Kaguraya-san followed them out as well.
P: Thanks to that, it was just me and Charlotte in the room now.
P: "A-kun..."
P: With just the two of us, Charlotte once again looked at me with longing eyes.
P: She must have been feeling emotionally drained after being apart during the move.
P: "Close your eyes."
P: "Ah... okay."
P: When I placed my hand on her cheek, Charlotte happily closed her eyes.
P: She was so honest and adorable.
P: I gently placed my finger under her chin and slowly leaned in closer to her.
P: "Chu..."
P: When our lips met, I felt the soft and moist sensation of Charlotte's lips.
P: And then--
P: "Amu... mmm..."
P: Charlotte immediately slid her tongue into my mouth.
P: It was as if she couldn't wait any longer and eagerly leaned into me.
P: I even had to brace myself with my feet to keep from being pushed over by her.
P: "A-kun... I love you..."
P: Her voice slurred as if she was drunk, and her face was flushed red like she had a fever.
P: Even so, her expression was endearing.
P: "Yeah... I love you too..."
P: I intertwined my tongue with hers and gently embraced her, stroking her head softly.
P: Her usual reserved demeanor made moments like these, when she was so assertive, hit me even harder.
P: "Pwah... haah... haah..."
P: Out of breath, Charlotte pulled back and panted heavily.
P: But--
P: "One more time..."
P: She didn't seem content to stop there and leaned in toward me again before catching her breath.
P: "Wait."
P: "..."
P: When I stopped her, Charlotte looked at me with puppy-like eyes, as if she had been denied a treat.
P: She was so cute it was almost unbearable.
P: "It's tiring to stay standing, so let's sit down for a bit."
P: I said, crouching down and putting my arms around Charlotte's back and legs.
P: Then--I slowly lifted her up.
P: It was the classic princess carry.
P: From her reaction the last time, I knew she'd be happy with this.
P: "A-kun... this is troubling..."
P: But Charlotte's reaction was different from what I expected.
P: "Huh...?"
P: "If you do this, I won't be able to hold back..."
P: "..."
P: I see, I understood what she meant.
P: But... hadn't the stopper already been removed?
P: "No one's watching, so don't worry about it."
P: Swallowing back my retort, I carried Charlotte to the bed and sat down.
Charlotte, who was lying sideways, placed her feet on the bed and wrapped her arms around my neck.
P: Then--
P: "Mmm... chu."
P: Just like before, she intertwined her tongue with mine.
P: This kiss-loving girl might not stop once I allowed it.
P: I had no intention of stopping either, at least until Kanon-san or someone else called out to us.
P: Even though I hadn't locked the door and felt a little uneasy about it, I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere by getting up to lock it now.
P: I trusted that Kanon-san and the others would knock before coming in, and as long as we weren't completely absorbed in the kiss, we'd notice.
P: Or so I thought as I continued to kiss Charlotte, but--
P: "--Big brother, where are youuuu!"
P: Emma-chan, who had woken up and realized Charlotte and I weren't there, burst into the room in tears.
P: 
P: ...Well, that took an unexpected turn.
P: 
H1: Chapter 2　"The Little Girl Loves Ramen"
P: 
P: 
P: "――How about ramen, Akihito, your favorite, for dinner?"
P: After Emma-chan barged in, a few hours had passed, and we had finished moving in the luggage when Kanon-san suggested dinner.
P: She remembered my favorite food well.
P: "…Ah-kun, you like ramen...?"
P: "Uh, yeah, I do…?"
P: Oh, now that I think about it... I haven't told Charlotte, have I…?
P: "Why didn't you tell me?"
P: Charlotte puffed out her cheeks slightly and looked at me with sulky eyes.
P: Does she think I was keeping it a secret…?
P: If I said it was because I didn’t need to mention it, everyone would probably get mad at me.
P: "…Ramen used to be my favorite, but now, Charlotte's homemade cooking is what I love most. That's why I didn't say anything—because I'd rather have your cooking."
P: I conveyed the first thing that came to mind.
P: Of course, it wasn't a lie.
P: Up until recently, ramen was my favorite, but now Charlotte's homemade cooking is number one.
P: "Ah-kun, that's unfair..."
P: Charlotte blushed and turned her face away from me.
P: Her lips, however, curled into a smile, suggesting she was pleased despite her words.
P: "Are we intruding?"
P: "Sister, shall we go to my room?"
P: It must have looked like we were flirting.
P: With warm smiles directed at us, Sophia-san and Kanon-san stood up.
P: Meanwhile, Emma-chan, currently sitting on my lap watching cat videos, didn't seem to care.
P: "You don’t need to feel obligated to leave…"
P: I quickly stopped the two, who looked ready to leave with polite smiles.
P: We couldn’t delay the dinner discussion just because of us, especially not when Emma-chan might get upset.
P: She is a child with quite a strong appetite.
P: "Since Akihito seems smitten with Charlotte-san’s cooking, I would love to ask her to make dinner, but she must be tired today. Let’s go out for ramen instead."
P: Kanon-san, with a teasing remark aimed at me, made the proposal.
P: She had been suggesting ramen since earlier, but it wasn’t for herself.
P: Since it was my favorite food, she thought we should go eat that.
P: "If it’s something Ah-kun loves, then I’m all for it."
P: Charlotte, now in a good mood, smiled brightly in agreement.
P: Clinging to my arm, she rested her head on my shoulder.
P: Even with her mother present, she didn’t seem to mind.
P: If anything, it felt like she was showing off.
P: "I agree too. I’d like Emma to try ramen as well."
P: When Sophia-san mentioned Emma, Emma-chan glanced up with a puzzled expression.
P: However, since Sophia-san wasn’t looking directly at her, Emma must have thought it wasn’t relevant and went back to her phone.
P: Speaking of which…
P: "I wonder if ramen isn’t very common in England?"
P: Not being familiar with international cuisine, I asked Charlotte.
P: "Oh, we do have ramen in England. Especially in London, where we lived, it was quite popular, and there were many restaurants. I used to go often—"
P: Charlotte stopped mid-sentence, as if realizing something, and glanced cautiously at Sophia-san.
P: "You used to go with Father a lot, didn’t you? He loved ramen too. But after Emma was born, we stopped going."
P: Sophia-san smiled kindly and shared the memory.
P: Charlotte must have stopped speaking out of consideration for Sophia-san.
P: For them, ramen seemed to hold memories of their father.
P: Since Charlotte came here, we hadn’t eaten out much, so it hadn’t come up, but I realized I might have unknowingly stepped on a landmine.
P: Now that the tension between Sophia-san and Charlotte was gone, it seemed okay.
P: "……"
P: Feeling like I had caused Charlotte some sadness, I reached out and held her hand.
P: "Ah…"
P: Charlotte looked at me happily, as if my feelings had been conveyed.
P: Seeing her cheerful again was genuinely uplifting.
P: "Now that everything’s settled, shall we go? To the usual place."
P: Urged by Kanon-san’s gentle smile, we set off to eat ramen.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "――Sophia-san, thank you very much."
P: When we arrived at the ramen shop, I expressed my gratitude to Sophia-san, who had driven us there.
P: In the parking lot of the new residence, there were two cars parked, both of which apparently belonged to Sophia-san.
P: One was the eight-seater minivan that she had used to drive us.
P: The other was a foreign car I had never seen before.
P: According to Charlotte, while in England, she had been using a standard family car, but according to Kanon-san, Sophia-san had apparently always driven expensive-looking cars like this.
P: The reason Charlotte hadn’t seen it before was probably because Sophia-san had been hiding the fact that she was a company president.
P: "Thank you, Onee-sama."
P: "I’m truly sorry for the trouble..."
P: Following my lead, Kanon-san also expressed her gratitude, while Kaguraya-san looked apologetic.
P: Even during the car ride, she had maintained this attitude the entire time.
P: For her, as a maid, having a client’s company president drive her must have been uncomfortable.
P: Moreover, before we left, Kanon-san had forcibly made her change into casual clothes, leaving Kaguraya-san visibly uneasy the whole time.
P: Honestly, both her attitude and outfit were rare sights.
P: "It’s fine, really. I wanted to drive. Besides, I bought this car in Japan specifically for this."
P: Initially, it was planned that Kaguraya-san would arrange a limousine, but Sophia-san had insisted on driving herself.
P: Since Sophia-san was of higher standing, Kaguraya-san had to give in.
P: "Mother can be quite forceful at times..."
P: For a moment, I thought that trait wasn’t like Charlotte, but upon reflection, I realized Charlotte could also be surprisingly forceful in her own way.
P: They’re not identical, but you can definitely tell they’re parent and child.
P: "Onii-chan, hug me."
P: From inside the car, Emma-chan, seated in a child seat, called out to me.
P: I felt a bit bad for Sophia-san, but it made me incredibly happy that even with her mother present, Emma-chan still wanted me to hold her.
P: "...I’ve lost to Akihito-kun..."
P: Yep, Sophia-san, who had noticed, looked somewhat shocked.
P: I felt a little sorry for her.
P: "――Tomato ramen?"
P: As we were about to enter the shop, Charlotte tilted her head curiously at a photo of ramen on the wall outside.
P: "Akihito likes the tomato ramen here."
P: "Does that mean it’s refreshing, since it’s made with tomato?"
P: It’s natural for Charlotte to imagine that.
P: When you hear "tomato," you often think of refreshing dishes like salads.
P: However, the ramen here was different.
P: It had the sourness and sweetness of tomatoes, making it light, yet it also had the rich flavor characteristic of ramen.
P: With a good amount of garlic, it was flavorful but easy to eat, thanks to the tomatoes. Honestly, it was incredibly delicious.
P: "You might think of it as being similar to Italian cuisine. The flavor is close to tomato spaghetti."
P: "That sounds delightful."
P: I was glad to see Charlotte looking forward to it.
P: Emma-chan, in my arms, was also swaying her body in excitement.
P: And so, when we entered――
P: "Kaguraya, this time you’ll sit with us."
P: Kanon-san urged Kaguraya-san, who had been about to stand behind her, to sit down.
P: "But..."
P: "If you remain standing, it will inconvenience the other guests, won't it? Moreover, Charlotte and the others won't be able to eat in peace. So, please, eat with us."
P: Ordinary customers aren't accustomed to the presence of young ladies accompanied by attendants, so having someone stand and wait alone would surely draw attention.
P: Regardless of Sophia's usual demeanor, even Charlotte would likely feel uneasy if Kaguraya were not eating.
P: That is why Kanon instructed her to eat together with them.
P: ――Well, they were already attracting attention, though.
P: "Hey, look over there... isn't that table incredible...?"
P: "Seriously, it's a lineup of beauties...!"
P: "Stunning... Could it be a gathering of celebrities?"
P: "Oh my gosh, they're so beautiful! Do you think I could get an autograph!?"
P: Sophia, Charlotte, and Emma, not to mention Kanon, are all stunningly beautiful girls.
P: Even Kaguraya, whose stern demeanor often leaves a strong impression, could be considered a beauty by general standards.
P: With so many beautiful women and girls gathered together, it was impossible not to draw attention.
P: "Hey, who’s that guy surrounded by them...?"
P: "I feel like I've seen him somewhere before――oh yeah, I saw him in a video before...!"
P: "Isn't he the guy from that video?"
P: "Oh my gosh, seriously!? Should I tweet about this...?"
P: Apparently, I had also become the center of attention in a different way.
P: It seems that video had spread far and wide.
P: Some people pointed their phone cameras in our direction, while others hurriedly started fiddling with their phones.
P: "...Should I stop them?"
P: "Eek!?"
P: The moment Kaguraya directed her gaze, the surrounding guests turned pale all at once.
P: It couldn't be helped—Kaguraya had a duty to protect her precious young mistress.
P: "Please refrain from showing such hostility. Matters should be resolved peacefully."
P: Kanon said this as she stood up and directed a gentle, kind smile at the surrounding guests.
P: Then, instead of approaching the guests, she walked toward the familiar store manager.
P: "I apologize for causing such a commotion."
P: "Oh! If it isn't the young lady! You've grown into such a mature and beautiful woman since the last time I saw you!"
P: When the manager noticed Kanon, he gave her a broad smile.
P: It seemed Kanon hadn't been to this establishment since the incident back in her middle school days.
P: "And you've brought along that boy and the maid girl who used to always be with you!"
P: The manager looked at Kaguraya and me with delight.
P: When we both bowed our heads, he waved his hands enthusiastically in response.
P: He was just as warm and easygoing as ever.
P: ...Even so, how did he recognize Kaguraya today when she wasn't in her maid outfit, unlike before?
P: "I hadn't seen you in so long, I thought you might never visit again!"
P: "My apologies. Many things happened, but I'm finally able to stop by again."
P: "I see, I see! Well, life sure has its ups and downs! Are those your friends!? They're all incredibly beautiful!"
P: "The girl sitting next to Akihito is his girlfriend. The other two are her mother and younger sister."
P: "Wait, Kanon-san!?"
P: Even though he was an old acquaintance who had treated me well, wasn’t that a bit too much information!?
P: "Oh, I see! Well, I always thought you’d end up with the young lady, but hey, you’ve snagged yourself a real beauty!"
P: The manager grinned as he looked back and forth between Charlotte and me.
P: It was almost like the reaction of a relative hearing their child had gotten a girlfriend.
P: Having been brought here often by Kanon since I was young, the manager might have grouped me, Kanon, and Kaguraya together in his mind.
P: "............"
P:  Charlotte smiled, but for some reason, she squeezed my hand tightly under the table.
P:  She probably wasn’t doing it because she was embarrassed.
P:  Most likely, she didn’t like being told that people thought I would end up with Kanon-san.
P:  "You two make a great pair, don’t you?"
P:  "Ah, no doubt about it! The boy has grown into a fine man, after all!"
P:  Despite the obvious mismatch in appearance, the manager agreed with Kanon-san’s words.
P:  Truly, he’s a good-hearted person.
P:  "By the way, Manager,"
P:  As the conversation paused, Kanon-san straightened her posture.
P:  It seemed like she was getting to the main point now.
P:  "Yes, what is it?"
P:  "I’m sorry to trouble you, but could you ask the customers not to take pictures of us or post about us on social media?"
P:  If we directly warned them, it might cause trouble.
P:  In such cases, it’s better to ask the staff, which is why Kanon-san went to speak with the manager.
P:  It’s far more amicable than sending Kaguraya-san.
P:  "Ah, sorry about that! I’ll take care of it!"
P:  "Thank you very much."
P:  Bowing deeply to the accommodating manager, Kanon-san returned to us.
P:  The manager immediately approached the customers and politely addressed the issue.
P:  Of course, he didn’t scold them; he simply made the request with a humble demeanor.
P:  "He’s such a thoughtful person, isn’t he?"
P:  Watching the manager carefully speak to the customers, Charlotte looked surprised.
P:  "From his manner of speaking and appearance, he might seem like a brash and quick-tempered man, but he’s really good at dealing with people."
P:  He’s the type who can naturally win people over, and he’s very popular with the customers.
P:  I once heard that some people visit the shop just to talk with him.
P:  —Well, that’s what the manager himself claimed, so the truth is unclear.
P:  "Now, let’s decide what to order, shall we?"
P:  "Akihito-sama, here you go."
P:  Reacting to Kanon-san’s words, Kaguraya-san handed me the menu.
P:  Looking over, I saw that Kanon-san and Sophia-san were already holding menus and browsing through them.
P:  "What would you like?"
P:  I held the menu so that Charlotte and Emma-chan, seated on either side of me, could see it and asked them.
P:  "Ah-kun, have you already decided?"
P:  "I’m going with tomato ramen."
P:  Besides tomato ramen, there were also typical options like soy sauce ramen, tonkotsu ramen, soy sauce tonkotsu, and tsukemen.
P:  But whenever I came here, I always chose tomato ramen.
P:  "Tomato ramen even comes with cheese, doesn’t it?"
P:  Charlotte pointed to a photo of tomato ramen topped with a large, golden-browned cheese.
P:  "Yeah, that one’s great too. It gives it a milder flavor."
P:  "Does it taste very different?"
P:  "Yeah, it’s so different that it doesn’t even feel like the same tomato ramen. Also, for tomato-based ramen, I recommend adding rice after finishing the noodles."
P:  With tomato ramen, you could order a noodle refill, but instead, adding rice turned it into a risotto-style dish.
P:  The rice came with options like garlic or cheese, making it highly recommended.
P:  "I don’t think I could eat that much…"
P:  True to her delicate appearance, Charlotte was a light eater.
P:  Eating rice after finishing ramen seemed to be a challenge for her.
P: 『…………』
P: Charlotte thought for a moment and then glanced at Emma-chan.
P: 『Emma, which one do you want?』
P: Since Emma-chan couldn’t finish a whole portion on her own, they would likely share whatever Emma-chan chose.
P: 『Hmm, the same as onii-chan.』
P: Without hesitation, Emma-chan pointed to the tomato ramen I mentioned I would order.
P: Even though she shouldn’t be able to read katakana at all, she must have figured out it was something red when she heard "tomato."
P: 『Perfect. Since I’ll be sharing with Emma, that means I can also try the extra rice option.』
P: 『Sounds good. Have Kanon-san and the others decided yet?』
P: I looked at Kanon-san, who was sitting across from me, and at Sophia-san and Kaguraya-san, seated on either side of her.
P: 『I’ll have the tomato ramen with cheese.』
P: Kanon-san always chose the cheese-topped option whenever she ate here.
P: Ordering the same thing she had in the past brought up a nostalgic feeling.
P: 『Hmm, I’ll go with the regular tomato ramen—because I love Akihito-kun.』
P: Sophia-san chose the same thing as me.
P: The real question was Kaguraya-san.
P: She still seemed hesitant to eat with her master.
P: 『Kaguraya, are you disobeying my orders?』
P: Kanon-san asked Kaguraya-san with a smile.
P: Of course, Kanon-san likely understood Kaguraya-san’s feelings.
P: In fact, in high society, it was unusual for a master and servant to eat together, so Kanon-san’s perspective was rather unconventional.
P: Even so, Kanon-san was being considerate of us and those around her.
P: 『No, it’s not that…』
P: 『You’ll need to get used to this. I believe there will be more occasions like this in the future.』
P: 『Understood…』
P: If Kanon-san planned to go out with me and Charlotte more often, dining out would naturally become part of the equation.
P: Since Kaguraya-san was almost always by Kanon-san’s side, not joining us for meals would draw unnecessary attention.
P: For us, it was much more convenient for Kaguraya-san to join in.
P: 『There’s no need to overthink it. As long as the master wishes for it, that’s all that matters.』
P: Seeing this, Sophia-san smiled and gave her reassurance.
P: Considering Sophia-san had driven herself even with Kaguraya-san present, it was clear why she supported Kanon-san’s viewpoint.
P: …Or perhaps Sophia-san had anticipated this situation all along.
P: By taking over the work that was originally Kaguraya-san’s responsibility, Sophia-san had demonstrated that she wouldn’t object to Kaguraya-san dining with the group.
P: This probably helped Kaguraya-san feel more at ease with the idea.
P: 『As my sister said, if anyone criticizes you, just explain that you’re following my orders. In fact, disregarding my orders would be the real issue.』
P: 『Yes, I’ll take you up on your kindness…』
P: Kaguraya-san slowly nodded.
P: 『Hehe, that’s better. Let’s eat together.』
P: Kanon-san nodded happily.
P: Perhaps she had wanted to eat with Kaguraya-san from the start.
P: 『Is Kaguraya-san special to Kanon-san?』
P: Charlotte, observing the two, asked me in a hushed voice.
P: 『Although they’re in a master-servant relationship, Kaguraya-san has been looking after Kanon-san since she was a child. So, yes, I think she’s special.』
P: 『Since she was a child…? But Kaguraya-san looks so young…』
P: Judging by Kaguraya-san’s appearance, Charlotte couldn’t reconcile the timeline in her mind.
P: It was no surprise she was confused.
P: 『Kaguraya-san’s family has served the Himehiragi family for generations. She’s probably been helping out since her student days.』
P: 『It sounds like something out of a manga…』
P: Charlotte looked at Kaguraya-san with fascination.
P: Her eyes gleamed with interest, clearly struck by the kind of story she loved from manga and anime.
P: Already intrigued by Kaguraya-san as a maid, Charlotte seemed even more captivated now.
P: In the end, Kaguraya-san chose the tomato ramen.
P: She likely avoided picking the same thing as her master, Kanon-san, and instead went with what the others had chosen.
P: When the ramen arrived—
P: 『Hmm…!』
P: Emma-chan eagerly held out a small serving dish to me with an excited expression.
P: "Emma, I'll give you mine, so lend me your dish."
P: "No…! I want onii-chan's…!"
P: When Charlotte reached out her hand, Emma-chan shook her head side to side and pulled back the dish.
P: "Mine is the same ramen as A-kun's, you know?"
P: "I want onii-chan's…!"
P: Apparently, it wasn’t about the taste of the ramen—she just wanted to get it from me.
P: "In that case, should I give you mine?"
P: Sophia-san reached out her hand, perhaps thinking it wasn't right for Emma-chan to get it from me.
P: "No…!"
P: But Emma-chan shook her head again.
P: "……"
P: Because of this, Sophia-san ended up looking a little sad.
P: "Emma-chan, give it to me."
P: "Okay…!"
P: When I reached out my hand, Emma-chan happily placed the dish in my hand.
P: It seemed she had her own little preferences.
P: "But A-kun, you'll run out…"
P: "It's fine. If I run out, I'll just order another serving."
P: While handing the portioned ramen to Emma-chan, I answered Charlotte.
P: Despite her appetite, Emma-chan was still young and couldn't eat that much.
P: Even the shop owner would probably allow an extra serving in this case.
P: "Ah, then why don't you take Emma's portion from mine, A-kun? That way, I can also have extra rice."
P: Now that I thought about it, Charlotte had originally ordered with the intention of giving part of her portion to Emma-chan.
P: As I pondered this—
P: "Okay…!"
P: Emma-chan once again held out her dish.
P: "Wait, did you already finish it!?"
P: "It was so yummy…!"
P: It seemed she liked the taste so much she ate it immediately.
P: At this pace… could it be…?
P: "Emma, I’ll give you mine—"
P: "No, it’s fine. I’ll give her mine."
P: Feeling a little curious, I gave Emma-chan the same amount again.
P: "A-kun…"
P: 
P: 　Charlotte gave me an apologetic look.
P: 　It was probably because I wasn’t eating as much as usual.
P: “Don’t worry about it; it’s fine.”
P: “Then, here you go…”
P: 　Saying that, Charlotte tried to give me twice as much as what I had shared with Emma-chan earlier.
P: 　If I took that much, Charlotte wouldn’t be able to eat anything herself.
P: “No, I really can’t take that much.”
P: “But…”
P: “It’s fine, really. I’ll just order another bowl of ramen.”
P: 　Judging by her appetite, Emma-chan seemed like she could still eat more.
P: 　At the rate she was going, she might finish another bowl, so it was better to order an extra ramen.
P: 　Meanwhile, Emma-chan, who had already emptied her bowl, looked at me with a hopeful expression.
P: “Then…”
P: 　Charlotte reduced the amount and put a more reasonable portion into my bowl.
P: 　Considering how much she usually eats, this seemed just about right.
P: “Onii-chan…”
P: “Yeah, hand me your bowl.”
P: 　When Emma-chan glanced up at me anxiously, I smiled and took her bowl.
P: 　She’s just a kid, so she shouldn’t hesitate and just enjoy her food.
P: “Here you go.”
P: “Thanks…!”
P: 　Emma-chan’s face lit up with a bright smile as she blew on her ramen to cool it down and started eating.
P: 　Meanwhile, I ordered another tomato ramen for myself.
P: “Akihito-kun, you’re such a good guy… I’m sure you’ll make a great father someday.”
P: “Yes, I completely agree. He’s my pride and joy as a little brother.”
P: 　For some reason, Kanon-san and Sophia-san began whispering to each other while looking at me warmly.
P: 　Their gazes made me feel a bit self-conscious.
P: “—Hey, is he really the guy who supposedly set up his teammates…?”
P: “That’s what they say, but… he doesn’t seem like it, does he?”
P: “Yeah… I mean, he looks so kind… and he really is kind…”
P: “Could it be that the rumors were completely baseless…?”
P: 　People around us were also glancing our way and talking about something.
P: 　I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but Charlotte, sitting beside me, had a cheerful smile, so it was probably something good.
P: 　As long as there wasn’t any hostility directed at us, that was good enough for me.
P: 　—While helping Emma-chan with her ramen, I also started eating the new bowl of ramen that had arrived.
P: 　In the end, Emma-chan finished an entire bowl of ramen, so she must have really liked it.
P: 　Although she didn’t have room for extra rice, it was still impressive that she ate a full portion.
P: 　I was so happy that Emma-chan enjoyed something I loved too.
H1: Chapter 3 "For Her Gift"
P: 
P: 
P: 　On the third day after moving, Charlotte wouldn't leave my side at all.
P: 　To be precise, it seemed like she was staying close to me to make sure I didn’t end up alone with Ms. Kanon or Sophia.
P: 　I don’t have anything to hide, but this made it impossible to discuss anything privately without Charlotte. 
P: 　So, I was at a loss.
P: “—Excuse me. Charlotte-sama, your bath is ready.”
P: 　While Charlotte was cuddling up to me on the bed, Kaguraya-san knocked and entered the room.
P: “Yes, thank you. I'll go take a bath now.”
P: 　Charlotte smiled warmly at me as she stood up from the bed.
P: 　We have a set order for bath time: Charlotte and Ms. Kanon take turns going first each day, followed by Sophia-san, then me, and lastly, the maid Kaguraya-san.
P: 　Originally, Sophia-san insisted on prioritizing the children, but since Emma-chan bathes with Sophia-san, I suggested they go ahead of me.
P: 　Charlotte and Kanon both tried to yield to each other, so Sophia-san proposed alternating the order, which is how we settled on this arrangement.
P: 　Although Charlotte seemed to prefer I go first, I felt it was better to prioritize the women.
P: 　As for Kaguraya-san, unlike the Himehiiragi household, this house doesn’t have a separate bath for staff, so she bathes last.
P: “Are you sure you don’t want me to wash your back?”
P: 　Since Kaguraya-san normally washes Kanon’s body, she seemed to think she should do the same for Charlotte and had been asking this question since day one.
P: “N-no, it’s fine. It would be embarrassing. Besides…”
P: 　Charlotte glanced at me with passionate eyes.
P: 　She seemed like she wanted to say something, but…
P: “I see, that would certainly be a problem if I went first.”
P: 　For some reason, Kaguraya-san shot me a disdainful look before smiling at Charlotte.
P: 　The way she treats me versus everyone else is still worlds apart.
P: “N-no, that’s not what I meant!”
P: 　Charlotte’s face turned bright red, and she waved her hands frantically in front of her chest to dispel any misunderstandings.
P: “Don’t worry, I’ll keep it a secret from President Bennett,” Kaguraya-san teased.
P: “No, that’s not it! It’s really a misunderstanding…!”
P: 　It seemed like Kaguraya-san misunderstood the glance Charlotte gave me earlier.
P: 　For someone as sharp as her, that was unusual.
P: 　…But judging from Charlotte’s reaction, it probably wasn’t a misunderstanding at all.
P: 　Well, I decided not to make a fuss about it.
P: 　Charlotte left the room with Kaguraya-san.
P: 　—This was the moment I’d been waiting for.
P: 　I waited a few minutes in the room to make sure Charlotte wouldn’t suddenly return, then headed to Kanon’s room.
P: “—This is Akihito. May I come in?”
P: 　After knocking on the door three times, I called out to her through the door.
P: “Yes, of course. Please come in.”
P: 　With her permission, I opened the door and stepped inside—
P: “—Is this a midnight ambush?”
P: 　I was restrained from behind, and something cold was pressed against my neck.
P: 　It was Kaguraya-san’s hand.
P: “Of course not…”
P: 　Sweat trickled down my body as I gulped nervously.
P: 　The tension was suffocating, and I felt like my life was in danger.
P: “Kaguraya, stop teasing Akihito.”
P: 　With a sigh, Kanon-san intervened and ordered Kaguraya-san to stop.
P: “You’ve been spared,” Kaguraya-san whispered in my ear before releasing me.
P: 　Why do I have to feel like my life is at stake over something like this…?
P: “…Kaguraya’s twisted affection is really something else…”
P: “Huh? Did you say something?”
P: “No, it’s nothing.”
P: 　When I asked Kanon-san what she murmured, she just smiled and dismissed it.
P: 
P: "You have something to discuss, right? Please come over here."
P: Kanone-san moved from the sofa to the bed and gestured for me to come closer.
P: It seems she wants to talk on the bed.
P: As expected, she quickly realized why I had come.
P: "Excuse me."
P: "We’re siblings, so there’s no need to be so formal, you know?"
P: When I sat down next to Kanone-san, she placed her hand on my head.
P: Then, she slowly and gently began to stroke my head.
P: Technically, we won’t officially be siblings until I graduate high school… but it seems she’s determined to treat me like her little brother.
P: "I’m still not used to this…"
P: "Take your time and get used to it at your own pace."
P: Her warm smile calmed my heart.
P: Kanone-san’s voice has a mysterious calming effect on others.
P: Like Charlotte’s, her voice is beautiful, but it also carries a mature and soothing tone, reminiscent of an adult woman.
P: Her lullabies could put a child to sleep in no time.
P: "So, what’s the matter you wanted to discuss?"
P: "Charlotte’s birthday is coming up soon, right? I want to give her a present, so I’d like to earn some money for it."
P: December 25th, Christmas, is Charlotte’s birthday.
P: This will be the first birthday I celebrate with her since we met, started dating, and got engaged.
P: I want to make it a memorable day for her, one she’ll cherish forever.
P: The gift I want to give her requires quite a bit of money.
P: "Money is already being deposited into your account every month, isn’t it? That includes not only living expenses but also your allowance. I’ve checked, and you’ve saved up a more-than-sufficient amount, even for someone no longer a student."
P: Indeed, money has been deposited into my account by the Himehiiragi family, and I’ve been covering my expenses from that.
P: Before Charlotte and the others came, I barely spent any money on entertainment, and even after they arrived, I didn’t spend much either.
P: Plus, thanks to Charlotte’s cooking, I saved a lot on food expenses, so I’ve managed to save an amount that doesn’t seem fitting for a student.
P: But this time, I don’t want to use that money.
P: "That money was originally intended to repay everything I’ve received so far."
P: My plan has always been to repay all the money I received once I started earning my own income.
P: Since I haven’t used much of it, I can return it in full, which is why I’ve been saving it.
P: "I expected no less from someone as diligent as you…"
P: Kanone-san sighed in resignation.
P: Her sigh was likely in response to me wanting to repay money that I’ve been told I didn’t need to return.
P: "The situation has changed, hasn’t it? Once you graduate high school, it’s decided that you’ll become part of our family. There’s no need to repay it anymore, so feel free to use it."
P: I understand the reasoning that I won’t need to repay it because I’ll become part of the family.
P: But even so, it’s not something I can easily accept with a simple "Okay."
P: "Originally, even if I was granted special recommendation status, the deal was that I’d only gain the Himehiiragi name and not be treated as part of the family. But I’ve always planned to repay it since then."
P: From the beginning, I intended to repay the money, even if I became part of the Himehiiragi family, so my stance hasn’t changed.
P: "That’s not the case."
P: "What?"
P: Kanone-san grabbed my hand with a serious expression, and I couldn’t help but look into her eyes.
P: "Until five days ago, even if you were granted special recommendation status, it would have only meant acquiring the Himehiiragi name. It didn’t mean you’d be treated as family."
P: Now that she mentions it, that’s true.
P: Even if I’d been added to the family registry, I’d have been treated more as a convenient tool than an actual family member.
P: I wouldn’t have been recognized as family.
P: "But now, it’s been decided that you’ll be welcomed into the family as a proper member. Whether you acquired the name as a formality or because you became part of the family makes a significant difference."
P: It’s a subtle but important distinction: whether the name was the goal or a side benefit.
P: "I know that Kanone-san recognizes me as family."
P: "Then please don’t say something as sad as repaying it."
P: While I feel obligated to repay it, Kanone-san interprets it differently.
P: Perhaps she took it as me not viewing her as family.
P: "That wasn’t my intention, but…"
P: "I know, Akihito, you’re just too serious. But if you consider me family, please don’t try to repay it."
P: It seems better to leave this issue unresolved for now.
P: After all, this wasn’t the main reason I came here to talk.
P: "I look up to you like an older sister, Kanone-san."
P: Until now, I viewed Kanone-san as more of a senior than a sister.
P: No matter how much she treated me as a younger brother, I couldn’t see her as an older sister since we weren’t family.
P: But now it’s been decided that we’ll become siblings.
P: So I’ve decided to start thinking of Kanone-san as my older sister.
P: ...Calling her "big sister" now feels impossible.
P: "This time, I want to buy it with money I've earned myself."
P: That is the reason I decided not to use my savings.
P: I felt it wouldn't be right to use the money I received from the Himehiiragi family.
P: However, even if I were to take on a regular part-time job now, with only a little over a week left, it wouldn't be feasible in many ways.
P: It's true that I should have prepared earlier, but at the time, I hadn't even considered buying what I'm planning to get now.
P: "I see. So you've come to rely on me. You want me to introduce you to a daily hire job if I have any leads, correct?"
P: As expected from someone sharp, she understood without me needing to say everything.
P: I've never had a part-time job, and I don't even know if I'd be able to find one as a daily hire in the remaining time.
P: More than anything, there's no guarantee I wouldn't end up with a suspicious job.
P: To resolve these concerns, I thought it best to consult someone knowledgeable.
P: "I want to respect Akihito's wishes as much as possible, but I have one question."
P: Kaname-san let go of my hand, straightened her posture, and observed me closely.
P: "You came to me while Charlotte-san was taking a bath. Does that mean you don't want her to know about this? In other words, you're planning a surprise gift, correct? If so, does that mean you're planning to lie to Charlotte-san about the time you'll be working and cover it up?"
P: Kaname-san's concerns are valid.
P: Just four days ago, Sharl and I promised to have no more secrets between us.
P: Kaname-san wasn't present when we made that promise, but she likely guessed it from Sophia-san mentioning it during the move.
P: "Considering I promised Sharl we wouldn't keep secrets, I'm struggling with whether it's okay to work in secret, even if it's to make her happy."
P: Even if it's a surprise, Sharl probably already knows I'm planning to give her a gift.
P: The surprise I want is for her to see the contents of the gift on her birthday and be delighted.
P: But that might just be me imposing my feelings on her.
P: Even if it's to make her happy, breaking our promise out of self-interest feels wrong to me.
P: "First of all, it's obvious, but breaking a promise isn't good," Kaname-san prefaced.
P: "However, regarding your promise with Charlotte-san this time, I personally think it's okay if it's to make her happy."
P: It seems she doesn't think breaking the promise is entirely bad in this case.
P: "The reason you both promised to stop keeping secrets was probably to prevent situations from worsening or damaging your trust in each other, wasn't it?"
P: "Yes, that's correct..."
P: We hadn't thought that deeply when we made the promise, but that's probably the gist of it.
P: "Then, there's no issue there. People don't typically get angry when things are hidden from them for their own good."
P: No issue there... which implies there's an issue elsewhere.
P: "What concerns me is whether Akihito is misjudging what should be prioritized."
P: Kaname-san spoke calmly.
P: She didn't seem angry, but she did appear somewhat dissatisfied.
P: Perhaps her earlier "question" was meant to address this concern.
P: "What do you mean?"
P: "What's the purpose of giving a birthday present?"
P: Kaname-san didn't answer my question.
P: Maybe she wanted me to think about it myself.
P: "To celebrate... no, to make the other person happy."
P: "What do you think is most important for that?"
P: What is...? It's their feelings, right?
P: "I think it's Sharl's feelings."
P: "Then, think back on what you're planning to do. While you're working, won't Charlotte-san feel lonely?"
P: "Ah..."
P: Indeed, I was so focused on keeping the secret that I hadn't considered how Sharl would feel while I was working.
P: There's no way my clingy and affectionate girlfriend wouldn't feel anything.
P: "You mustn't misjudge what's truly important. I understand your hesitation to use the money you're given, but you're still a dependent. It's normal to receive an allowance, so why not buy something within a typical allowance range? She would be happy with anything you give her."
P: It's about valuing time over money.
P: Under normal circumstances, I would accept this reasoning. But...
P: "............"
P: I couldn't find the words to respond.
P: I understand Kaname-san's point and think it's valid.
P: But still, just this once, I want to give her a gift bought with money I earned myself—and this timing can't be missed.
P: "Kaname-sama, may I interject for a moment?"
P: While I was lost in thought, Kaguraya-san unexpectedly joined the conversation.
P: "What is it?"
P: Kaname-san smiled and turned her gaze toward Kaguraya-san.
P: "I feel it's presumptuous of me to make a suggestion, but how about having Akihito-sama help with household chores and paying him for it? While Charlotte-sama prefers to cook, there are still plenty of tasks to be done. If he helps me, the payment could come from my own salary."
P: That was... unexpected.
P: I never thought Kaguraya-san would throw me a lifeline.
P: "What do you think? This way, Charlotte-san can stay with Akihito, and it can simply appear as though he's helping around the house."
P: Kaname-san smiled as she turned to me for confirmation.
P: It was an appealing proposal, but...
P: "I couldn't possibly accept payment for something like helping out at home..."
P: "Are you belittling my work?"
P: When I hesitated, Kaguraya-san shot me a sharp glare.
P: "N-no, that's not what I meant...!"
P: I hurriedly shook my head from side to side.
P: I had no intention of insulting her, but my earlier statement did indeed seem like a denial of Kaguraya-san's work.
P: It was an unacceptable slip of the tongue.
P: "Then, the matter is settled. However, I will not deduct this from Kaguraya's salary. As the master of the house, it would be far too disgraceful if I lacked that much generosity."
P: Apparently, my statement had acknowledged that this was indeed work.
P: Well... considering Kaguraya-san's level, she was meticulous enough to spot even a speck of dust, and she always took care of Kaname-san with unwavering dedication. It was undoubtedly impressive work.
P: But if you ask whether I can perform at her level—honestly, it's impossible.
P: That said, it wasn’t the kind of atmosphere where I could say such a thing.
P: "Thank you... I’ll graciously accept your kind offer."
P: Considering not only the atmosphere but also Sharl, this arrangement seemed to be the best choice.
P: I decided to stop overthinking unnecessarily.
P: "By the way, may I ask one last question?"
P: Just as I thought the conversation was over, Kaname-san leaned in close to whisper in my ear.
P: "W-what is it...?"
P: I instinctively tensed up.
P: "What exactly are you planning to buy, going to such lengths?"
P: For once, Kaname-san looked amused as she smiled at me with a mischievous glint in her eyes.
P: This—she might have already figured it out.
P: "Do I have to tell you...?"
P: "I won’t force you, but I am curious. Besides, depending on the item, I might be able to pull some strings for you."
P: Not only was Kaname-san wealthy, but her good nature had also earned her many connections.
P: Since I couldn’t afford any mistakes, having her help would honestly be a blessing.
P: Still... it was incredibly embarrassing.
P: "Um, please keep this to yourself, okay...?"
P: "Of course. It’ll be our little secret as siblings."
P: With a beaming smile, Kaname-san leaned in to listen.
P: Even Kaguraya-san seemed interested, staring intently at me.
P: At this distance, she might overhear, but I quietly shared the secret with Kaname-san.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "—Oh, Akihito-kun."
P: As I left Kaname-san's room and walked down the hallway, I ran into Sophia-san.
P: In her arms, Emma-chan was sleeping peacefully.
P: "Emma-chan fell asleep, huh?"
P: "I took her out for a walk, but it seems she got sleepy."
P: Currently, Emma-chan was staying in Sophia-san's room.
P: That was simply the arrangement, but Emma-chan often roamed freely, sometimes visiting her mother’s room or ours, depending on her mood.
P: Today, it seemed she wanted to spend time with Sophia-san, so she had been in her room.
P: "She seems happy to be able to live with her mother again."
P: "…I’m sorry for making you take care of her."
P: "Huh...?"
P: I looked up from Emma-chan’s sleeping face to find Sophia-san looking at me apologetically.
P: Maybe my earlier comment came off as sarcastic.
P: "Sorry, I didn’t mean to complain..."
P: "Don’t worry, I understand. Is Lottie in the bath right now?"
P: Probably because we weren’t together, Sophia-san glanced around curiously as she asked.
P: "Yes. If you need something, I can let her know?"
P: "No, it’s nothing like that. Since it’s rare for us to run into each other, how about chatting in my room for a bit?"
P: It seemed the person she needed wasn’t Sharl but me.
P: Though, it was probably just for some casual conversation.
P: Now, what should I do...?
P: I’m happy that Ms. Sophia invited me, but since we reunited, we haven’t had much time to talk at length.
P: I’d like to take the chance to talk if I can… Even with Charlotte here, I think it would be possible.
P: Well, there’s a slight chance Charlotte might start to get jealous, though…
P: Especially when it’s with her mother, she seems to be even more wary…
P: “Is it no good…?”
P: Ms. Sophia peered into my face as if trying to read my expression.
P: Even though she’s older, I’m taller than her, so she ended up looking up at me.
P: Since she’s Charlotte and Emma’s mother and an incredibly beautiful woman, most men would fall for something like this.
P: But I have Charlotte, so I’m fine.
P: “Well, sure… It’s fine.”
P: Seeing how much she wanted to talk, I nodded in agreement.
P: Charlotte, who can now bathe on her own, has been taking longer baths lately, so she probably won’t return for a while.
P: If it seems like it’ll take too long, I can cut it short and suggest another day.
P: “Great, then let’s go.”
P: Ms. Sophia smiled and led the way, and I followed her to her room.
P: “I’ll have to wake her up when it’s time for her bath.”
P: Ms. Sophia gently stroked Emma’s head as she lay her on the bed.
P: Her expression was warm and loving, the very image of a mother who adores her daughter.
P: Emma is still at her cutest, youngest age, and the time spent apart must have been hard on Ms. Sophia as well.
P: “Come sit next to me?”
P: Ms. Sophia sat on the sofa and patted the spot next to her.
P: Why does everyone want me to sit next to them?
P: “Excuse me.”
P: “You don’t have to be so formal.”
P: When I sat beside her, she gave me a resigned smile.
P: Even though her expression was different, it reminded me of Kanon from earlier.
P: “It’s still a bit…”
P: “It’s been about ten years, so it’s natural. You’ll get used to it over time.”
P: I ended up being told the same thing again.
P: Both of them give off the calm aura of mature women, so I guess they have that in common.
P: “Thank you… So, what did you want to talk about?”
P: “I just wanted to say how grateful I am to you, Akihito. I’ve said it before, but thank you for saving Lottie.”
P: Ms. Sophia gave me a gentle, heartfelt smile as she expressed her gratitude.
P: Her figure overlapped with the memory of her from nearly ten years ago.
P: “It wasn’t that big of a deal…”
P: Embarrassed, I looked away, trying to downplay her praise.
P: I don’t feel like I did anything so grand as to “save” Charlotte.
P: “It’s not an exaggeration. Without you, that girl would still be tormented by guilt.”
P: Her words brought back memories of Charlotte when she first arrived in Japan.
P: Prioritizing Emma above all else, she seemed to live solely for her sister’s sake.
P: It stemmed from the guilt she felt, thinking she might have caused someone’s death.
P: But in recent days, while still caring for Emma, she has started to rely on me more.
P: Partly thanks to Ms. Sophia watching over Emma, Charlotte seems to have let go of her lingering guilt and moved forward.
P: Thinking back, Charlotte had gradually begun to express her honest feelings to me, even before clearing up misunderstandings with Ms. Sophia, and had started showing jealousy towards Emma.
P: It seemed like she had been changing inside all along.
P: “Still, I think Ms. Sophia would have found a way even without me…”
P: I still can’t fully grasp her depths, but she’s so reliable that being around her puts me at ease.
P: Given her intelligence, she probably would’ve managed somehow.
P: “After more than five years of trying everything?”
P: Ms. Sophia smiled bitterly at herself.
P: The incident happened when Emma was still in her belly, meaning it’s been that long.
P: She must have tried every possible solution during that time, but nothing worked.
P: “Even so, Ms. Sophia didn’t give up. Thanks to that, Charlotte and I were able to meet, right?”
P: From what I’ve heard, if it hadn’t been good for Charlotte, she wouldn’t have brought her here.
P: She probably would’ve found some other way to resolve the issue for me without involving her daughter in an arranged marriage.
P: “I’m sorry for using you, Akihito.”
P: “It’s not like that… You helped me, and I’m incredibly happy to be with Charlotte, so please don’t apologize. If anything, I’m the one who’s grateful to you.”
P: Normally, someone like me wouldn’t be able to become the boyfriend of someone as amazing as Charlotte.
P: It’s like something out of one of the manga she loves so much.
P: “Hearing you say that makes me feel better too.”
P: Ms. Sophia breathed a sigh of relief.
P: I guess she couldn’t help but feel uneasy about the methods she used, even though she let us decide on our own in the end.
P: Her tone has changed, but she’s still the kind, dependable older sister figure, which reassures me.
P: “To give Ms. Sophia peace of mind, I’ll do my best to become a man worthy of Charlotte.”
P: Ms. Sophia must know just how amazing Charlotte is, even if she’s her daughter.
P: It wouldn’t be surprising if she thought there were better men out there for her than me.
P: The bar is high, but I have to become the kind of man who wouldn’t make Ms. Sophia regret her decision.
P: But—
P: “What are you saying? Akihito, you’re already more than enough of a wonderful man.”
P: She tilted her head, looking puzzled.
P: “There’s no need to flatter me…”
P: “It’s not flattery. You’ve kept your promise to me and grown into a remarkable man. I can say that with confidence.”
P: Ms. Sophia spoke with a serious expression.
P: It didn’t seem like empty praise, but wasn’t she overestimating me?
P: “Do you think so…?”
P: “It’s rare to find a man like you, someone recognized by Kanon, Kaguraya, and Lottie. Their standards are high, you know?”
P: High standards?
P: This is the first I’ve heard of that!
P: Why is Kaguraya-san brought up in this situation...?
P: "I think Kaguraya-san dislikes me though...?"
P: "Ah, that child is a bit special, you see. There are situational issues too."
P: Sophia-san nodded to herself as if she was convinced of something.
P: What’s so special about it?
P: "Speaking of which, I don't think Kanon-san or Kaguraya-san even see me as a romantic interest in the first place...?"
P: Kanon-san treats me completely like a little brother, and Kaguraya-san—what even is she?
P: A punching bag?
P: At the very least, it’s clear I’m not seen as a man.
P: "Well, no, they don't see you as a romantic interest. But both of them recognize you as a man in their own way. It's not unusual to raise a younger brother into their ideal man, is it?"
P: Does that mean the current me is the result of Kanon-san shaping me through her guidance to reflect her ideals?
P: That seems far too presumptuous, though...
P: "If the dynamics were different, perhaps—well, maybe there could have been something. But of course, I’d never say that in front of Lottie."
P: Sophia-san gave a playful wink.
P: She’s implying that I wasn’t seen as a romantic interest because I was treated like a younger sibling or a subordinate.
P: If Charlotte overheard this, she’d probably feel uneasy, maybe even jealous.
P: "But, I’m not that handsome, am I?"
P: It’s not that I think I’m ugly, but I don’t think I’m particularly good-looking either.
P: Standing next to an idol or a handsome celebrity, I’d probably fade into the background.
P: "No one cares about appearances. Instead, everyone values inner qualities greatly. Though, I think Akihito-kun's face is handsome enough."
P: Apparently, I’ve made her feel the need to be considerate.
P: She’s completely treating me like a child.
P: Well, I guess I don’t mind at this point...
P: "Haha... Thank you. But do you think Charlotte’s standards are that high? I don’t really feel that way..."
P: In front of her, I’ve shown plenty of pathetic, indecisive sides of myself.
P: And yet, she still says she likes me.
P: I don’t think her ideals are that high.
P: "First, she’d expect someone very kind with an embracing nature who accepts everything. Then, they’d also need to be intelligent and reliable, someone who can help in times of trouble. On top of that, they should pamper her a lot and be admired by others too. Honestly, out of the three of you, she probably has the highest standards."
P: Sophia-san explained fluently, counting on her fingers as she spoke.
P: How does she come up with all this?
P: "Can you really tell all that...?"
P: "She’s my daughter. Of course I can tell by watching her. Besides, those are my ideals too."
P: But just because those are Sophia-san’s ideals doesn’t necessarily mean Charlotte’s are the same, does it?
P: Wait, does this mean Sophia-san is also the pampered type?
P: That’s surprising... but I guess it makes sense since they’re mother and daughter.
P: "I feel like I’m far from meeting those standards... Especially being admired by others. I was more disliked, really."
P: Charlotte saw that firsthand on the day we first met.
P: So I doubt I match her ideals.
P: "Ideals are just that; you don’t need to fulfill every single one. But, Akihito-kun, you’re putting yourself down too much. That’s not a good thing."
P: "Ugh...!"
P: Sophia-san hit me with a straight truth, smiling all the while.
P: She’s definitely thinking, "What a pain this guy is."
P: This is where she differs from Charlotte.
P: Back in the day, she wasn’t this blunt. Perhaps my growth has made her more honest with me.
P: "I’ve heard from Kanon-chan about how you’ve been doing at school—both middle school and high school."
P: Given that I was being watched, and with Miyu-sensei around, I’m sure everything got relayed to Kanon-san.
P: Looking back, I regret my behavior that made me disliked. It caused Charlotte trouble and even hurt her.
P: "Being admired doesn’t mean you actually have to be admired. It’s more about having a personality that makes people think, ‘This person could be loved by others.’ Charlotte saw the real you and understood you had your reasons, so she wasn’t bothered."
P: In fact, since Charlotte likes me, Sophia-san might be right.
P: Maybe Emma-chan’s trust in me had a big impact too.
P: Back then, Emma-chan was closed off to everyone except family. If such a person trusted me, others must have thought I was trustworthy too.
P: She must have closely observed how I treated Emma-chan.
P: "Well, I’m just grateful to have been liked."
P: "More than that, she’s practically dependent on you."
P: "Haha..."
P: Having my relationship with Charlotte known by her mother is incredibly embarrassing.
P: Fortunately, Sophia-san doesn’t seem to see her dependence as a problem.
P: Some might say dependency is bad and try to separate us, though.
P: "She can’t live without you now, so take full responsibility, okay?"
P: Well, maybe Sophia-san is only okay with it because she expects me to handle it.
P: We’re engaged anyway, so there’s no worry about separation.
P: "I promise to make her happy."
P: "Yes, I trust you. That girl is a lot to handle, and you’re probably the only one who can."
P: Even with her own daughter, she shows no mercy.
P: Come to think of it, she was relentless about that doujinshi incident too.
P: Could Sophia-san be scarier than I realized...?
P: "Don’t worry, I think she’s incredibly cute."
P: "Oh, that’s reassuring. She’s always been indifferent about most things compared to others, but when she falls for something, she becomes intensely passionate. Her possessiveness and jealousy skyrocket."
P: Charlotte’s tendency to immerse herself in what she loves is something I’ve noticed.
P: When it comes to manga, anime, or cosplay, she talks about them so passionately it’s like she forgets about her surroundings.
P: 　I've seen her intense possessiveness and jealousy, so I think it's true.
P: 　But still—despite all that, I find her incredibly cute.
P: 　I'm probably completely infatuated with her too.
P: "From the way you put it, does that mean Charlotte had a boy she liked?"
P: 　Since the word jealousy came up, I didn’t think she was just talking about things.
P: 　It was probably something that happened with a person.
P: "Not so much a boy I liked, but I guess it was like that with my father. When I talked to him, she’d get jealous of both of us and sulk."
P: 　The story she told was much more endearing than I had expected.
P: 　By "both," it seems she adored not just her father but also Sophia.
P: 　Judging by how Sophia acts now, it’s hard to imagine, but it could happen when she was younger.
P: 　With Emma around, it’s easy to imagine a jealous little Charlotte from her childhood.
P: "And then, though it wasn’t a boy, when she made a close girl friend, it was pretty intense. If that friend played with other friends, she’d puff up her cheeks like Emma and come back."
P: 　If it’s a girl, there’s no need to worry.
P: 　It seems Charlotte has always shared some traits with Emma.
P: 　Even now, at her core, she still has a childlike side. They’re fundamentally similar sisters.
P: "What happened with that friend?"
P: "We went to the same high school and commuted together, so I think they still keep in touch?"
P: 　Even so, it’s surprising that Charlotte is fine without seeing her friend.
P: "Did she stop depending on that friend by then?"
P: "It seemed like it stopped around the time Emma was born."
P: 　In other words, that marked Charlotte’s growth—not in the sense of maturing, but learning to suppress her feelings.
P: 　She probably felt she had to step up as a substitute for her father and couldn’t rely on others as much.
P: 　Even so, why doesn’t Charlotte talk about that friend?
P: 　If they were close, she could have mentioned it… but maybe there was no opportunity.
P: "Don’t worry. Right now, Akihito is definitely the most important to Charlotte. Friends and boyfriends are different, after all."
P: 　Did she think I was getting jealous and trying to dig for details?
P: 　She gave me a reassuring smile as if to soothe me.
P: "It’s fine, I’m just happy Charlotte has close friends."
P: "…Why does this feel like such a difference in composure…?"
P: 　She gave me a helpless smile, as if to say she had no choice.
P: 　She might have been comparing me to Charlotte, but I wouldn’t get jealous over a girl friend to begin with.
P: 　Charlotte wouldn’t get jealous over Akira either… right?
P: 　I was starting to lose confidence.
P: "Anyway, just be careful with Lottie. Akihito, you seem to be quite popular these days."
P: 　It seems that’s what she really wanted to say.
P: 　But wait a moment.
P: "I don’t know what Kanon said, but I’m really not popular…?"
P: 　After all, the only one who has confessed to me is Charlotte.
P: 　Well, I did hear something during the sports festival, but that was just in the moment...
P: "……"
P: 　Sophia looked at me as if she was seeing something pitiful.
P: 　She seemed like she had a lot to say.
P: "Um…?"
P: "Even if you’re not aware of it, Akihito, drama tends to happen regardless. Be careful."
P: 　She patted me on the shoulder as if to say "good luck."
P: 　It felt like she was giving up on something.
P: "At least when I do make her jealous, I try to pamper her as a countermeasure…"
P: "I hope your body can handle it."
P: 　Sophia smiled warmly while saying something outrageous.
P: 　What on earth does she see in me?
P: "Do I seem that bad…?"
P: "Since you’re officially together, it might be less worrisome, but… you do seem likely to stir things up without realizing it."
P: "What is that supposed to mean!?"
P: 　Her serious expression made me reflexively retort.
P: "The human heart isn’t so easily controlled. You should be careful not to become a natural playboy. Although, it might already be too late."
P: 　Sophia gazed into the distance as if she had given up.
P: 　Basically, I should try not to make people fall for me?
P: 　I don’t think that’s a problem…
P: "Anyway, I think we’ve talked too much. Charlotte might be out of the bath soon, so you should head back."
P: 　Checking the time, I realized it had gotten quite late.
P: 　Including the time I spent in Kanon’s room, this might not be good.
P: "Sorry, I’ll head back now…!"
P: "Yes, let’s talk again."
P: 　I stood up and bowed slightly. Sophia waved me off.
P: 　Hurrying back to my room—
P: "……"
P: 　—Charlotte was sitting on the bed, waiting.
P: 　I was late.
P: "Oh, you’re out of the bath? Did you already tell Kanon?"
P: 　I tried to stay calm and spoke with a smile.
P: 　If I had just come back, she might assume I had just gone to the restroom.
P: 　But—
P: "……"
P: 　Charlotte looked up, her cheeks slightly puffed out, tears in her eyes.
P: 　Yeah, she definitely figured it out…
P: "Um, well…"
P: "……"
P: 　Charlotte stood up and looked at the bed.
P: 　She was probably telling me to sit down.
P: 　And it seemed I was right—when I sat, Charlotte immediately climbed onto my lap.
P: 　It was rare for her to do so without asking.
P: 　She must be really upset.
P: 　She pressed her face against my chest without saying a word.
P: 　It seemed she was holding back her frustration to avoid becoming overly clingy.
P: "Sorry, I was just talking with Kanon and Sophia. Nothing inappropriate happened."
P: 　I didn’t try to make excuses, just stated the facts.
P: 　Charlotte looked up at me with tearful eyes.
P: "It’s okay. This is just my selfishness…"
P: 　She probably thought it was wrong to be upset about me talking to them without her.
P: 　That's why, without complaining, she seems to endure and rely on me.
P: 　Honestly, she's so earnest and adorable...
P: "I love you, Charl, and I would never romantically love anyone other than you. Especially not your mother or the woman who is going to be my sister. Still, is there something that bothers you?"
P: 　At times like this, it's better to let her express her feelings rather than just forcing her to endure it.
P: 　These past few days, I couldn't understand why she seemed so wary of me, so I thought this was a good opportunity.
P: "I'm scared..."
P: "Huh? Of what?"
P: 　When Charl forced herself to tell me in a strained voice, I couldn't understand her meaning and ended up asking further.
P: "Your mother used to be the older sister you admired... and Kanon-nee-san is indeed your sister now, but she's an unrelated childhood friend, a truly beautiful Yamato Nadeshiko. I'm scared that you might choose them over me."
P: 　Charl clung tightly to my chest, trembling.
P: 　She wasn't joking.
P: 　My actions were too careless.
P: 　Even I would feel uneasy if the man Charlotte admired or her cool childhood friend appeared, especially if we were living together.
P: 　For the past few days, Charlotte had been feeling like that but kept it to herself.
P: 　She probably wanted me to at least stay within her sight when talking to others.
P: "I'm sorry for making you feel this way."
P: 　I gently hugged Charlotte and softly stroked her head.
P: "Please don’t apologize… It’s just me being strange…"
P: "You’re not strange. If I were in your position, I’d feel the same way."
P: 　She might be a little possessive, but I don't think these feelings are wrong.
P: "A-kun…"
P: 　Charlotte pressed her cheek against mine, nuzzling me affectionately.
P: 　She probably liked it because it made it easy to feel each other's warmth and softness.
P: 　I let her do as she pleased.
P: "…………"
P: 　After a few minutes, Charlotte slowly pulled her cheek away.
P: 　Then, with her eyes full of passion, she gazed intently at my face.
P: 　She seemed ready to move on to the next step.
P: "A kiss…"
P: "Yeah, close your eyes."
P: When I asked Charlotte, who was looking at me with a longing expression, she closed her eyes and lifted her chin.
P: As if to say she was fully prepared, I slowly brought my lips closer to hers.
P: When our lips touched, Charlotte actively intertwined her tongue with mine.
P: Who could have imagined her, usually so clear and reserved, acting like this?
P: The people at school would never have guessed.
P: "――I belong to Charlotte, so don't worry."
P: While catching my breath, I gently stroked Charlotte's cheek.
P: "A-kun, you're too kind……. If you treat me so gently, I won't be able to let go of you……?"
P: Perhaps she was implying that the reason Charlotte is so clingy and wants to be with me is because I spoil her.
P: "In fact, I don't want you to let go."
P: I love it when Charlotte clings to me, and I want to stay close and attached to her.
P: So, if she becomes unable to let go, it’s only convenient for me.
P: However, if that causes her pain, that’s a different story.
P: "I’m being pulled deeper and deeper into a swamp……. And it’s a bottomless one……"
P: As she said this, Charlotte pressed her face against my neck.
P: And then――a shivering sensation ran down my neck.
P: It seemed like she was kissing me.
P: Moreover, she was sucking strongly and for a long time.
P: This……if it leaves a hickey, won’t Kanon and the others tease me……?
P: Though I thought that, there was no way I could stop Charlotte now.
P: Since she’s finally being honest about what she wants, stopping her now would only make her hold back again.
P: I’ll just put a bandage on it later.
P: Still……maybe this is her way of marking me as hers.
P: "Mmm……"
P: Eventually, Charlotte pulled her lips away.
P: "Satisfied?"
P: "Not yet……"
P: Saying that, she kissed me again, this time on my lips.
P: I firmly accepted it and continued to kiss her repeatedly.
P: "…………"
P: As time passed unnoticed, and we kissed over and over――Charlotte gently placed her hand on my chest.
P: Her eyes, moist with passion, were completely flushed, and it was clear she was asking for more.
P: "Um――"
P: ――Knock knock knock.
P: "「――Huh!?」"
P: Just as Charlotte was about to say something, whether the timing was good or bad, the door was knocked.
P: "Y-yes……!"
P: I immediately responded, and Charlotte hurriedly got off my lap and sat next to me, pressing her shoulder against mine.
P: "Excuse me. I apologize for interrupting, but the bath is ready, so Akihito-sama, please go ahead."
P: The person who entered the room was Kagura-san, who had come to inform us that Sophia and the others had finished their bath.
P: Both Charlotte and I had bright red faces, so it was probably obvious we had been getting intimate.
P: "Understood, I’ll go right away."
P: "Ah……"
P: As I stood up, Charlotte looked at me with a lonely expression.
P: "I’ll come back as soon as I can, okay?"
P: Since Kagura-san couldn’t take a bath until I did, that had to take priority.
P: So, I patted Charlotte’s head and asked her to wait.
P: "――Another postponement……"
P: As I left the room, I thought I heard Charlotte mutter something――.
P: "Please don’t get carried away, okay?"
P: Kagura-san, who had left the room first, pointed at her own neck and gave me a cold look, so I was in no position to argue.
P: I forgot to put on the bandage…….
H1: Chapter 4　"The Beautiful Foreign Student Gets Excited"
P: 
P: 
P: From the next day, I was entrusted with household chores.
P: Though, to be honest――.
P: "There's still dust here. Do it again."
P: Under Kagura-san's strict guidance, I was just cleaning.
P: After coming home from school, I’ve been doing this the whole time.
P: "Um, I’ll help too……?"
P: Charlotte, who was watching from the side, offered to help.
P: However――.
P: "We’re just training him so he won’t embarrass himself wherever he goes, so Charlotte-san, please just watch. We’re pushing him a bit harder to finish this in about a week."
P: Kanon-san smoothly provided a reason.
P: Since Charlotte had just become a member of the Himezuki household, she had no choice but to accept it as normal.
P: "I’ll take care of all the household chores……?"
P: ――I thought so, but Charlotte wasn’t convinced.
P: "I understand how Charlotte-san feels, but we can’t spoil Akihito too much. He needs to learn the basics at least."
P: "The basics……?"
P: Charlotte tilted her head in confusion, looking at me and Kagura-san.
P: "He needs to clean the floor so well that it can be licked. He’s still not polished enough."
P: "Yes……!"
P: While being glared at by Kagura-san, I desperately wiped the floor with a cloth.
P: "……Isn’t this a bit too much?"
P: Honestly, I felt the same way as Charlotte.
P: No matter how you look at it, it doesn’t need to be that clean, right?
P: However――Kagura-san, or rather, the maids and butlers of the Himezuki household, really cleaned to that level.
P: That’s why the Himezuki house was as clean as a newly built mansion.
P: "We can lower the standard, but that would extend the time needed. In that case, your time together would――"
P: "――A-kun, do your best……!"
P: It seemed Charlotte had been smoothly convinced.
P: The most important thing for us was our time alone together…….
P: 'Huff, huff!'
P: By the way, right next to me, Emma-chan was mimicking me and wiping the floor with a cloth.
P: Since she volunteered to do it, she probably wanted to do the same thing as me.
P: Kanon-san also allowed Emma-chan to participate, saying it would be good for her future studies.
P: 'Emma-chan, isn’t it tiring?'
P: 'Nn……!'
P: When I asked, she gave me a lively response.
P: Recently, she’s been playing soccer, so her legs and hips still seemed to have plenty of energy.
P: I couldn’t afford to lose.
P: So, I continued to be worked hard by Kagura-san while cleaning.
P: And then, after cleaning all the rooms――.
P: "Let’s go shopping."
P: I ended up going shopping with Kagura-san and Charlotte.
P: This was a usual thing, but today Emma-chan was staying home.
P: She seemed tired from cleaning and was already taking a nap.
P: Kanon-san would be looking after her.
P: "A-kun, you must be tired, so you can wait at home……"
P: Charlotte, who was worried about me, said this while trying to gauge my expression.
P: "No, it’s fine. You need someone to carry the bags, right?"
P: Before, it was just for three people, but now it’s for six people.
P: Naturally, the amount of ingredients also increased.
P: "Besides, the time I can spend with Charlotte is precious."
P: I intertwined my fingers with Charlotte’s left hand.
P: "Ah……"
P: Charlotte blushed and looked at me happily.
P: Even though we were together the whole time, I had been cleaning, so she must have felt a little lonely.
P: I wanted to spoil her at times like this.
P: "…………"
P: Kagura-san gave me a cold look, as if to say, "You’ll flirt whenever you get the chance," but she didn’t say anything, probably because Charlotte would feel self-conscious.
P: She kept her distance, creating a space just for the two of us.
P: "What would you like to eat today?"
P: "Anything you like is fine, Charlotte."
P: Her homemade cooking was genuinely delicious.
P: She always considered the nutritional balance, so there was no need for me to request anything specific.
P: "I want to make what A-kun wants to eat."
P: While squeezing my hand, Charlotte rested her head on my shoulder.
P: It seemed her clingy switch had been turned on.
P: I walked while keeping an eye on the surroundings to make sure no cars were coming.
P: From an outsider’s perspective, we probably looked like a couple of lovebirds.
P: Kagura-san’s gaze was piercing.
P: "Charlotte’s cooking is always delicious, so anything is fine…… But I wonder what Emma-chan would want to eat?"
P: Since she helped with the cleaning, it would be better to let Emma-chan eat what she wants today.
P: Well, the main person, Emma-chan, isn’t here right now.
P: "A-kun, you always put Emma first, don’t you?"
P: "You do too, right?"
P: Charlotte prioritized Emma-chan more than I did.
P: Even though things have changed recently, she’s still a young child, so it’s natural to prioritize her.
P: "For us, she’s like a little sister, but also like a child. It’s only natural to prioritize her, right?"
P: "…………"
P: Charlotte said this with a distant look in her eyes, as if she wasn’t fully aware of what she was saying.
P: Well, we’re already engaged…… So it’s a bit late to be thinking about this now.
P: "I want a child like Emma-chan."
P: "Ah……!"
P: My words made her realize her slip of the tongue.
P: Charlotte hurriedly covered her mouth, but the words had already been spoken.
P: Her face turned bright red.
P: "Ah, um, I didn’t mean anything by that……! I just really think of Emma as my own daughter……!"
P: "Haha, it’s fine. We’ve even talked about you playing the mother role and me playing the father role before."
P: Even though she’s my real sister, the age difference makes her seem like a daughter, so I understand how Charlotte feels.
P: She probably didn’t say it with the intention of us becoming husband and wife.
P: "But……"
P: Charlotte seemed to have more to say, as she looked down and started rubbing my fingers with hers.
P: And then――
P: "I also want a child like Emma…… As soon as possible……"
P: ――Charlotte looked up at me with a feverish expression.
P: This time, she was probably aware of what she was saying.
P: She’s always been proactive at times like this.
P: But still…… I never expected her to say "as soon as possible"…….
P: It’s probably just her feelings talking, though.
P: "Yeah, I agree."
P: While feeling embarrassed, I smiled back at Charlotte.
P: I’m sure we’ll have a child like Emma-chan someday.
P: When that happens, we’ll probably spoil them a lot.
P: "I want to grow up quickly……"
P: "There’s no need to rush. It’ll happen soon enough."
P: Though, having a child might still be a long way off.
P: Even though we’ll be adults next year, we’re still high school students.
P: We’re not earning our own living yet, and after graduating high school, we plan to go to university instead of getting jobs.
P: Thinking about it, it’s still a long way off.
P: At the very least, we need to be able to support ourselves first.
P: 
P: "……Really, as soon as possible……. I can’t wait anymore……"
P: 
P: Charlotte muttered something under her breath.
P: She started rubbing my fingers again, so I thought she had something to say, but――she was just looking down.
P: It seemed like she was talking to herself.
P: I decided not to tease her and let her cling to me as we headed to the supermarket.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: On Saturday morning――.
P: "Charlotte-san, would you like to go out with me?"
P: Suddenly, Kanon-san invited Charlotte out.
P: "Eh, me……?"
P: Charlotte was clearly flustered.
P: She probably never expected Kanon-san to invite her out.
P: "Is that no good?"
P: "No, it’s not that……!"
P: Seeing Kanon-san’s sad expression, Charlotte hurriedly shook her head.
P: She was completely under Kanon-san’s control.
P: Inviting her on the same day instead of in advance was probably part of her strategy.
P: "Th-then, A-kun will come too……!"
P: Even though Kagura-san was there, being alone with Kanon-san made Charlotte nervous, so she looked at me for help.
P: Normally, I would have joined her, but…….
P: "I want to spend time alone with Charlotte-san, is that no good?"
P: "Why do you want to be alone with me……?"
P: Even though we’ve started living together, Charlotte and Kanon-san weren’t exactly close, so Charlotte asked in confusion.
P: She couldn’t understand why Kanon-san wanted to exclude me.
P: "There are things only girls can talk about, right? There are also some things I’d like to ask you."
P: "…………"
P: While Kanon-san smiled beautifully, Charlotte looked at me with teary eyes, scared.
P: For some reason, she seemed afraid of Kanon-san.
P: "She’s a kind person, so it’s fine, right?"
P: I didn’t know why Charlotte was scared, but it would be pitiful to let her go out in this state, so I tried to reassure her.
P: Then, Charlotte stretched up and whispered in my ear.
P: "Will Kanon-nee-san scold me……?"
P: "Eh, what are you talking about……?"
P: Since Charlotte hadn’t done anything to anger Kanon-san, I asked back.
P: "Well…… because I took A-kun away, she might hold a grudge……"
P: I see, so Charlotte was on guard because Kanon-san wanted to talk to her alone.
P: Well, in a normal male-female relationship, that might be a possibility…….
P: "Kanon-san was happy for us, and she’s not the type to hold a grudge. I think she just wants to spend time with you."
P: To be honest, Kanon-san wasn’t just trying to spend time with Charlotte or talk to her.
P: She was trying to take Charlotte out for my sake.
P: "Is it really okay……?"
P: It was natural for Charlotte to feel uneasy since she hadn’t known Kanon-san for long.
P: When you don’t know someone well, you can’t tell what they’re thinking.
P: "Don’t worry. If anything happens, just contact me right away."
P: At Charlotte’s suggestion, we had set up our phones so we could see each other’s locations.
P: In case something happened, we could know where the other was――that was the idea, but it was also useful in situations like this.
P: On the other hand, since she could also see my location, I needed to come up with excuses for where I was going.
P: "This is to deepen our sisterly bond, so please don’t worry."
P: Even though she couldn’t hear our conversation, Kanon-san probably understood what we were talking about from our expressions and the situation.
P: She added this with a smile.
P: "It’s fine……"
P: Charlotte forced a smile and didn’t refuse the invitation.
P: Kanon-san would become my sister, so from Charlotte’s perspective as my fiancée, she would be her sister-in-law.
P: That’s why Charlotte called her "Kanon-nee-san," but she couldn’t refuse an invitation from someone like that.
P: It’s natural to want to be liked by your partner’s family.
P: "Also, Akihito has household chores to practice, and I need him to run an errand to Okayama Station, so he can’t come with us."
P: "Eh……?"
P: Charlotte looked at me in confusion, as she hadn’t heard about any errands.
P: "…………"
P: She gave me a look that seemed to say, "I want to go with you……," but this time, I couldn’t grant her wish.
P: The reason Kanon-san was taking Charlotte out was so she wouldn’t find out what I was buying.
P: "I’ll take Emma-chan with me, so don’t worry."
P: Emma-chan was still sleeping in Sophia-san’s room.
P: Sophia-san had to work on her day off, so I was supposed to look after her.
P: This way, it would seem to Charlotte that Kanon-san really wanted to spend time alone with her.
P: "…………"
P: This time, she gave me a look that seemed to say, "You’re taking Emma but not me……?"
P: I understood what she meant, but I pretended not to notice.
P: "Kanon-san, please don’t push Charlotte too hard."
P: "Of course. We’ll just go shopping together and have a café date."
P: Wait, why did she say "date"?
P: She’s enjoying this situation, isn’t she?
P: "A d-date!? I have A-kun, so……!"
P: Charlotte, who took Kanon-san’s teasing seriously, blushed and clung to my arm.
P: Despite her seemingly extensive knowledge of intimate matters, she’s still pure at heart.
P: "Fufu, it’s heartwarming to see how close you two are."
P: While Charlotte was flustered, Kanon-san remained calm.
P: It was easy to imagine how their relationship would develop.
P: "By the way, Akihito, here."
P: After smiling at us, Kanon-san handed me something she had received from Kagura-san, who had been silently watching.
P: "Glasses?"
P: What she handed me was a pair of black-framed glasses, and I couldn’t understand the intention.
P: My eyesight is fine, so…….
P: "They’re non-prescription glasses. The lenses have UV protection."
P: "――Eh!?"
P: As Kanon-san explained, Charlotte started fidgeting.
P: She looked at me expectantly, glancing at me repeatedly.
P: "If you wear these, no one except acquaintances will recognize you. You’ve become quite famous, so it’s better to take precautions when going out."
P: I see, that would prevent any strange people from bothering me.
P: As for Emma-chan, I could just have her wear a cat-eared hood.
P: She’d be happy to wear it if it had cat ears.
P: "Thank you."
P: I thanked Kanon-san and accepted the glasses.
P: ――Tug tug.
P: Suddenly, my sleeve was pulled.
P: "What’s wrong?"
P: When I looked at Charlotte, who had pulled my sleeve, she opened her mouth nervously.
P: "Um, aren’t you going to put them on now……?"
P: It seemed she really wanted to see me wearing glasses.
P: "I’m not used to glasses, so I’ll put them on when we go out."
P: Since she seemed so eager, I decided to tease her a little.
P: Maybe she’d do something cute to beg me.
P: But――.
P: "…………"
P: Instead of begging, Charlotte just looked down sadly.
P: She probably thought she couldn’t force me, so she held back.
P: "Just kidding, how about this?"
P: Not wanting to make her sad, I quickly put on the glasses.
P: Charlotte’s face lit up as soon as I did.
P: "They look great……! They really suit you……!"
P: She must have really liked them.
P: Charlotte was unusually excited.
P: "As expected, intellectual-looking glasses suit Akihito well. He looks very smart."
P: Kanon-san also nodded in satisfaction.
P: She was probably the one who chose them.
P: "Now then, Charlotte-san. Let’s get ready and go."
P: "Eh, right now!?"
P: Charlotte, who had been excited, was startled by Kanon-san’s interruption.
P: "We’re going out for a while, so I’d like to leave soon. Please get ready."
P: Charlotte, who hadn’t planned to go out, was wearing casual home clothes.
P: If she was going out, she’d want to dress up.
P: That would take some time, so Kanon-san was asking her to start now.
P: ――Well, she probably brought it up at this timing on purpose.
P: Kanon-san seemed to be teasing Charlotte.
P: "Ugh…… Then, at least let me take a photo……!"
P: Perhaps to look back on later, Charlotte took out her phone and looked up at me.
P: She seemed to be asking for permission with her eyes.
P: ……No, her pleading upward glance was more like a request.
P: "Do they really suit me that much?"
P: I didn’t have a mirror, and I hadn’t worn glasses before, so I couldn’t tell.
P: "They really suit you……!"
P: Well, if Charlotte was this excited, they must look good on me.
P: Her anxiety about going out with Kanon-san seemed to have disappeared.
P: "Charlotte-san, let me take it. I’ll take a photo for you."
P: As Charlotte was taking photos of me from up close, Kanon-san offered her hand.
P: She probably wanted to take a photo together.
P: "Thank you……!"
P: Charlotte happily handed over her phone and immediately clung to my arm.
P: While distracted by Charlotte resting her head on my shoulder, I looked at the lens of Kanon-san’s phone.
P: "Okay, say cheese."
P: With a click――the shutter sound echoed.
P: "Um, can we take one more……?"
P: As soon as the photo was taken, Charlotte pressed her index fingers together and made a request.
P: ――Not to me, but to Kanon-san.
P: "Of course."
P: Kanon-san readily agreed and raised the phone again.
P: And then――the moment Kanon-san said the cue for the photo, something soft and moist touched my cheek.
P: A fraction of a second later, when I looked to the side, Charlotte was covering her mouth with her hand, her cheeks red, looking up at me with upturned eyes.
P: It was obvious what she had done.
P: "Fufu, it’s really wonderful."
P: Kanon-san, who had seen everything, approached us with a warm smile.
P: 
P: "Here you go. I think it turned out beautifully."
P: As she said this, the screen of the smartphone she showed me displayed a photo of Charlotte kissing my cheek.
P: "Thank you so much...!"
P: Charlotte happily took the smartphone and immediately started operating it.
P: It seemed she had set it as her wallpaper.
P: To kiss me in front of Kanon-san and Kagura-san... She's as bold as ever...
P: "Can you send it to me too?"
P: "Yes, of course...!"
P: "Thank you."
P: Charlotte sent me the photo via a chat app, and I set it as my wallpaper as well.
P: I hadn't taken many photos, so I was honestly really happy.
P: Since we'll be together for a long time, I hope we can take lots of photos from now on.
P: "Well then, I'll hurry and get ready...!"
P: Seemingly satisfied with the photo, Charlotte left the living room.
P: Since she seemed fine with going out, this must have been the right thing to do.
P: But... I wish she had waited just a little longer.
P: "You've got yourself a cute and affectionate wife, haven't you?"
P: Now, I was the only one being teased by Kanon-san's smiling face...
P: After that, Charlotte got ready and left with Kanon-san.
P: It was still early, and the shops weren't even open yet, so they must be going somewhere far.
P: For me, it was a relief not to have to worry about running into them.
P: "Well, I guess I'll fold the laundry that's been drying and do some cleaning."
P: I had been instructed not to touch the underwear, but everything else was my responsibility.
P: The clothes were drying in the bathroom, so I just needed to take them in.
P: Even so... This bathroom is larger than those in ordinary homes, so the previous residents must have been wealthy.
P: The bathtub is also big, so two adults could easily fit in it.
P: "............"
P: For a moment, I imagined taking a bath with Charlotte, but with others around, it would be difficult.
P: What should I do for Christmas...?
P: The room I used to live in is still there, and I still have the key.
P: If we want to be alone and relax, that might be the best place.
P: There's no way we could go to a hotel...
P: Thinking about such things, I started folding the laundry.
P: There were six people's worth, so it was quite a task.
P: Inside the dryer were towels and socks, but all the underwear had been neatly removed.
P: Kagura-san must have taken them out beforehand.
P: Well, it's a relief for me too, as it avoids any awkward suspicions.
P: "Good morning, you're working hard."
P: After a while, Sophia-san came down holding Emma.
P: She must have been awake for a while, waiting for Emma to wake up in her room.
P: "Good morning. Good morning, Emma."
P: "Good... morning..."
P: Emma rubbed her sleepy eyes and greeted me in Japanese.
P: She had gotten into the habit of greeting in Japanese, so she could now speak it properly for greetings.
P: "You're working hard for Lottie's present, thank you."
P: Perhaps not wanting Emma to understand, Sophia-san continued the conversation in Japanese.
P: Well, Emma was still sleepy and didn't seem to mind the Japanese.
P: Before I knew it, she had pressed her face against Sophia-san's chest.
P: "There's no need to thank me. I'm just doing this on my own."
P: "Hey, what kind of present are you planning to give her? I asked Kanon-chan, but she told me to ask you directly and wouldn't tell me."
P: Sophia-san looked at me with excitement, her eyes sparkling.
P: It seemed Kanon-san had kept her promise and didn't say anything, even to Sophia-san.
P: It was embarrassing, and I didn't want too many people to know, but I couldn't lie to Sophia-san.
P: "Well..."
P: Even though there were only three of us here, I whispered just to be safe.
P: Hearing the details, Sophia-san smiled warmly.
P: "That's... really wonderful."
P: Just like with Kanon-san, she surprisingly approved of it.
P: Normally, people would tell me not to overreach or to stick to something more student-like.
P: I'm really grateful to be surrounded by such understanding people.
P: "Do you think she'll be happy...?"
P: "Hehe, she'll definitely be happy. She might even be so happy that she ends up pushing you down."
P: Sophia-san laughed cheerfully and winked at me.
P: Well, it's not entirely impossible that she might push me down...
P: She can be quite assertive and proactive at times.
P: "But still, it's amazing... How many high schoolers do you think would come up with such an idea?"
P: Sophia-san looked at me with admiration, resting her chin on her hand.
P: "Ahaha... I know I'm reaching a bit..."
P: "No, age doesn't matter. I can feel your determination, and I think it's admirable. I thought you were just a precocious kid because of your upbringing, but... you're really not like a child in a good way."
P: Sophia-san praised me very favorably.
P: It was nice to be acknowledged by the mother of the girl I was dating.
P: For a moment, I wondered if she was calling me an old man, but that couldn't be it given the context.
P: She was talking about my inner self.
P: "It's because of who you are that Lottie can be so affectionate with you."
P: "That's good to hear."
P: I don't know how Charlotte feels, but if she's being affectionate, she must see me as someone she can rely on.
P: As her boyfriend, that's an honor.
P: "Well then, I'll have breakfast."
P: "Ah, I'll feed Emma."
P: Since I had already eaten, I could feed Emma while Sophia-san ate.
P: "Thank you, I'll leave it to you."
P: Sophia-san handed Emma to me, and I carefully took her so as not to drop her.
P: 'Emma, wake up.'
P: 'Nnn...?'
P: I gently patted her shoulder, and Emma looked up at me with sleepy eyes.
P: She must have fallen asleep again while we were talking, so she was still very tired.
P: 'It's time for breakfast.'
P: 'Mmm... no... sleep...'
P: It was unusual for Emma, who usually has a big appetite, to still want to sleep.
P: 'I guess there's no helping it... Can you let her sleep a little longer?'
P: Perhaps thinking it wasn't good to force her awake, Sophia-san asked me to let her sleep.
P: 'Alright, I'll feed her later.'
P: In this state, she would probably eat while dozing off.
P: It would be better to feed her after she wakes up properly.
P: 'I have to go after eating...'
P: 'Ah, that's fine. Good luck with work.'
P: She had work to do, so it couldn't be helped.
P: I was originally planning to take care of Emma after this, so there was no problem.
H1: Chapter 5 "Encounter with the Teary-Eyed Blonde Beauty"
P: 
P: 
P: "――Ah~n, munch munch."
P: About thirty minutes after Sophia-san had eaten, I was feeding Emma-chan, who had just woken up.
P: "Is it delicious?"
P: "Mmm……!"
P: Even though it was just reheated, Emma-chan seemed satisfied as she ate.
P: Charlotte's homemade food is still delicious even when reheated, which is really amazing.
P: After continuing to feed her like that――.
P: "Are we going out to play……!?"
P: After making sure she brushed her teeth properly, when I told her we were going out, Emma-chan's mood skyrocketed.
P: Hearing that we were going out, she seemed to mistake it for going out to play.
P: Well, it should be fun, so it's not a problem.
P: "Emma-chan, do a 'banzai' for me."
P: "Banzai!"
P: Just as I told her, Emma-chan raised both hands and struck a banzai pose.
P: In the meantime, I put a cat-eared hoodie on her from above.
P: "Kitty?"
P: "That's right, it's a kitty outfit."
P: "Mmm!"
P: Seeing the cat ears on the hood, Emma-chan nodded with satisfaction.
P: As long as there are cat ears, anything is fine.
P: "Let's go then."
P: "Carry me……!"
P: When I was about to leave after getting ready, Emma-chan spread her arms wide.
P: As always, she's a child who asks to be carried whenever she gets the chance.
P: "We'll go outside first today."
P: If I carry Emma-chan, there will be no one to lock the door, so we have to go outside first.
P: "Mmm……!"
P: I thought she might be shocked by the misunderstanding, but Emma-chan nodded as if she understood.
P: Maybe she realized that there was no one to lock the door since she always sees Charlotte doing it.
P: Since we were about to go outside, I put on my glasses.
P: "Oh~?"
P: Seeing this, Emma-chan tilted her head curiously.
P: It must be because she's not used to seeing me like this.
P: "How do I look?"
P: "Mmm, cool……!"
P: It seems Emma-chan liked it too.
P: "Emma-chan, let's put on your hood."
P: I put the hood on Emma-chan's head.
P: "Nyaa……!"
P: Emma-chan curled her hands like cat paws and looked up at me.
P: With the cat-eared hood on, she must have decided to imitate a cat.
P: "You look like a little kitty. Let's go then."
P: "Mmm……!"
P: Emma-chan reached out her tiny hand to hold mine.
P: As always, if she can't be carried, she'll hold hands instead.
P: With that, the two of us went outside and locked the door.
P: Then――.
P: "Mmm……!"
P: As if she had been waiting, Emma-chan spread her arms wide.
P: I bent down, wrapped my arms around her securely, and picked her up.
P: "――Train……!"
P: When we arrived at the station, Emma-chan's face lit up at the sight of the familiar building.
P: "That's right, it's the train."
P: "Ride……!?"
P: She must want to ride it.
P: She asked with anticipation.
P: "Yeah, let's charge the card."
P: "No ticket……?"
P: Since Charlotte usually buys the tickets, she must have thought I would buy one this time too.
P: When she realized I wasn't going to buy one, she looked at me with sad eyes.
P: Emma-chan is only five years old, so she doesn't need a ticket, and I use an IC card, so I don't need to buy one either…….
P: "Do you want a ticket?"
P: "Mmm……!"
P: Emma-chan nodded vigorously.
P: Well, it's just a little extra trouble, so it's fine.
P: "Then let's buy a ticket."
P: "Emma will buy……!"
P: She seemed to want to buy it herself.
P: Since this is also a learning experience, I decided to teach her how to buy one.
P: "The station name and price are written here, so look for the station you want to go to, find the price, and press the button with the same number."
P: I pointed to the price chart next to the ticket machine and explained it to Emma-chan.
P: "……Can't read."
P: However, since Emma-chan can't read Japanese, she puffed out her cheeks in dissatisfaction.
P: I knew that, but I wanted her to remember it for when she can read in the future.
P: "Today, we're buying――"
P: I told her the price, and Emma-chan pressed the button.
P: "……♪"
P: Emma-chan happily took the ticket that came out.
P: Of course, Emma-chan also put the ticket through the gate.
P: "Train, coming?"
P: When we reached the platform, Emma-chan stared intently in the direction the train would come from.
P: She must remember which side the train to Okayama Station comes from since she's a smart kid.
P: "It's coming soon."
P: "Hurry……!"
P: Emma-chan, who was eager to ride the train, swayed her body and urged me on.
P: "It's dangerous, so don't move around too much, okay?"
P: "Mmm."
P: But when I warned her, she immediately calmed down.
P: Since she behaved well, I patted her head while waiting for the train to arrive.
P: "――It's here……!"
P: When the announcement played and the train came into view, Emma-chan's eyes sparkled.
P: Since it's the countryside, there weren't many people boarding the train at this time, so the seats were mostly empty.
P: "Do you want to sit by the window?"
P: "Mmm……!"
P: I confirmed with her, and since Emma-chan nodded, I let her sit by the window in a two-seater.
P: Then I sat next to Emma-chan, but――.
P: "…………"
P: She puffed out her cheeks and silently looked up at me.
P: She must not have liked being put down.
P: "Do you want to sit on my lap?"
P: "Mmm……!"
P: Emma-chan nodded and climbed onto my lap.
P: So I held her securely and moved to the window side.
P: "Do you like the scenery, Emma-chan?"
P: "Mmm, like……!"
P: No wonder she was staring so intently out the window.
P: Next time, I want to take her somewhere with a beautiful view.
P: And so, while being soothed by Emma-chan's excitement, I headed for Okayama Station.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "――Thank you for coming today. Please give my regards to Lady Himezaki as well."
P: As we left the store we had come to, a woman who introduced herself as the manager bowed with a smile.
P: This store is managed by the family of a friend of Kanon-san, so they were able to make some special arrangements for us.
P: Thanks to that, I was able to buy something with a nice design within my budget.
P: Well, in the end, my part-time job earnings weren't enough, so I had to dip into my savings.
P: Since I couldn't go shopping right before Charlotte's birthday without her finding out, this was unavoidable.
P: I plan to replenish my savings once my next paycheck comes in.
P: "Thank you as well. Thanks to your advice, I was able to make a wonderful purchase."
P: "No, no, I was just doing my job. I'm sure she will be delighted with what you bought."
P: "Yes, I think so too. Thank you very much."
P: I bowed and left the store.
P: "――It's been a while since I've seen such a well-mannered student……. As expected of someone the owner has taken an interest in……. But still…… to sell something with a 0.3-carat fancy vivid natural pink diamond at such a bargain price…… well, it's the owner's orders, so there's no helping it……. Now then, I should quickly put all the price tags back and reopen the store."
P: I thought I heard the manager muttering something behind me, but when I turned around, she was just entering the store, so it must have been my imagination.
P: "Where are we going next?"
P: Emma-chan, who wasn't very interested in jewelry, asked while shaking her head.
P: She must have gotten bored since I kept her waiting.
P: "Are you hungry?"
P: "I'm fine."
P: When I asked if she was hungry, Emma-chan shook her head.
P: Well, it hasn't been that long since she ate, so that makes sense.
P: Even though our errand was done, it would be too pitiful to just go home after bringing her all the way here.
P: As for what Emma-chan might be interested in――.
P: "Do you want to go see a soccer ball?"
P: "Yes……!"
P: I remembered that there was a sports shop in the large shopping mall near Okayama Station, so I asked, and Emma-chan's eyes sparkled.
P: She's really into soccer right now, so she seemed happy with the suggestion.
P: "Let's go check it out then."
P: "Mmm……!"
P: We started walking toward the large shopping mall.
P: On the way――.
P: "Ah!"
P: We ran into two familiar people.
P: "You surprised me, Aoyagi-kun. What's with the glasses?"
P: Since we were in the city, Shimizu-san, who was dressed up, asked with a puzzled expression.
P: "Senpai with glasses…… nice……."
P: For some reason, Kosaka-san, who was with Shimizu-san, had a slightly flushed face and was staring at me blankly.
P: It's an unusual combination.
P: "Well, it's for self-defense, I guess."
P: "Ah, I see. You're kind of famous now."
P: Shimizu-san elbowed―― no, jabbed Kosaka-san beside her while smiling and asking.
P: "What are you doing……!?"
P: Of course, Kosaka-san, who had been suddenly jabbed, glared at her.
P: "You're drooling over someone who's already taken, that's why."
P: "Th-that's not true……! You're just making things up!"
P: "Where am I wrong? It's so obvious……!"
P: Somehow, the two of them started butting heads and sparks were flying.
P: Even though they often argue at school, they still hang out together a lot.
P: Well, it seems like they're just teasing each other, so they must actually get along well.
P: They say that the more you fight, the closer you are, after all.
P: But…… Emma-chan, who doesn't like noise, was getting grumpy in my arms, so it might be better to leave soon.
P: "Hey, hey, both of you. There are people around, so stop arguing."
P: For now, it's clear that their arguing is making Emma-chan upset, so I decided to calm them down.
P: "It's the gyaru's fault for picking a fight……!"
P: "I told you to stop calling me that……! I'm just playing with you because I feel bad that you have no friends……!"
P: Whoa, whoa, that's a landmine for Kosaka-san……?
P: "――! I didn't ask you to drag me out like this……!"
P: Kosaka-san, who is sensitive about not having many friends, retorted with a changed expression.
P: It seems Shimizu-san was the one who invited Kosaka-san this time.
P: Well, Kosaka-san is surprisingly shy, so she won't come out on her own unless someone invites her…… so maybe forcefully dragging her out like this is just the right approach.
P: "You replied instantly when I invited you, though!"
P: "Don't exaggerate! No one was happy about it, and you can't tell that from a chat app message……!"
P: Hmm, she didn't deny replying instantly.
P: I could easily imagine Kosaka-san's face lighting up and eagerly responding when she got the invitation message.
P: "You're really not honest……!"
P: "I am honest……!"
P: Well, well, this is troublesome.
P: They're getting more and more heated.
P: Shimizu-san is usually the type to laugh off provocations, but maybe because of how they first met, she tends to retaliate when it's Kosaka-san.
P: Well, from what I can see, it feels more like she's dealing with a younger sister than a junior.
P: Maybe she thinks of Kosaka-san as a troublesome little sister?
P: "Being honest is more like Charlotte-san or Shinonome-san……!"
P: "That's harsh……! Akito-senpai, please say something……!"
P: Kosaka-san tried to get me on her side.
P: Honestly, whether she's honest or not is debatable.
P: She's polite and listens to me and Charlotte, but she often clashes with Akira and Shimizu-san, and she even provokes them.
P: On top of that, she doesn't listen to what they say and badmouths them―― but she doesn't seem to genuinely dislike them.
P: In fact, she even seems to enjoy arguing with them.
P: It often looks like she's just teasing them.
P: Seeing that, I can't help but think she's not very honest.
P: At the very least, she's not as honest as Charlotte or Karin.
P: "You two seem to be having fun."
P: "Where do you see that!?"
P: When I said what I was thinking, they both asked in unison.
P: They must be getting along well, right?
P: Even though they're arguing like this, neither of them suggests leaving.
P: "What are you two planning to do next?"
P: "Ignoring us……"
P: "Akito-senpai, you're like that sometimes……"
P: Since I brushed them off, they both looked dissatisfied.
P: Well, at least the focus shifted to me.
P: "So, what are you going to do?"
P: "Haa…… we'll just wander around and look at stores, I guess."
P: Shimizu-san let out an exaggerated sigh and told me their plans.
P: Window shopping, I suppose.
P: "Akito-senpai, it's rare to see you without Charlotte-senpai. And who's that child……?"
P: Kosaka-san seemed curious about the child I was carrying and looked at her with interest.
P: However, Emma-chan had already buried her face in my chest.
P: She must have gotten grumpy from the noise and decided to take a nap.
P: "She's Charlotte's little sister."
P: "Ah, so that's her……! I didn't recognize her with the hood on."
P: "Wait, have you met before?"
P: "Well, not exactly…… but yes. Also, she was a topic of conversation during the sports festival, so I know about her."
P: Now that I think about it, I did bring her to the sports festival.
P: It's only natural that such a cute child in the students' tent would become a topic of conversation.
P: Since she's Charlotte's sister, her hair color makes it obvious.
P: "Is she asleep?"
P: Kosaka-san seemed to want to see her face and leaned in to peek into my arms.
P: Her arm was touching mine, and her face was close, but she didn't seem to notice.
P: "Hey."
P: "Hyaa!?"
P: When Shimizu-san poked both of her sides from behind, Kosaka-san's body jolted.
P: She lightly clenched her hands in front of her chest like a cat and seemed to freeze.
P: "Wh-what are you doing……!?"
P: When she came to her senses, she turned to Shimizu-san with a bright red face.
P: "What am I doing, you ask? You're really careless, you know."
P: "What do you mean!?"
P: "Pretending to be innocent while getting so close…… that's just sly."
P: "Wha!?"
P: Shimizu-san's remark seemed to hit home, and Kosaka-san froze again.
P: "Th-that's not true……! You're just making things up!"
P: And so, Kosaka-san, who clearly had no self-awareness, started denying it vehemently.
P: Hmm, I kind of get the feeling that these two only argue like this because I'm around.
P: If there were no third party, Kosaka-san might be more honest and talk normally with Shimizu-san.
P: ――So, while the two of them were arguing, I decided to quietly fade out.
P: "Akito-senpai, please teach this mean gyaru a lesson―― huh, senpai……?"
P: "While you were busy making excuses, he disappeared."
P: "I was abandoned!?"
P: Somehow, I could hear Kosaka-san's surprised voice from behind, but going back would just repeat the same thing, so I didn't return.
P: "Now then, what should I do……?"
P: Despite all the noise, Emma-chan was completely asleep.
P: This child must have the ability to consciously block out unpleasant sounds.
P: Thanks to that, I'll have to deal with a grumpy Emma-chan when she wakes up.
P: Of course, by "deal with," I mean calming her down.
P: "For now, I'll wake her up when we get to the shopping mall――"
P: "――Waaaaah, what should I do!? Someone, help me!"
P: "English……?"
P: Suddenly, I heard a voice crying out in English.
P: Looking in the direction of the voice, I saw a girl with fluffy, natural blonde hair tied in twin tails, crying.
P: The ends of her hair were tied into small buns.
P: From what I could see, she seemed to be around my age.
P: "What's wrong?"
P: Since she was crying, I couldn't ignore her and decided to ask.
P: "English!? You understand English!?"
P: Noticing me, the girl quickly looked up and leaned in close.
P: Her wide, sky-blue eyes were as clear as the ocean.
P: Her well-defined nose and almost translucent white skin.
P: She was a beautiful foreign girl with features that would catch anyone's attention.
P: She seemed to be around my age.
P: ……That aside, her face is way too close……?
P: "Yeah, I can handle everyday conversations……."
P: From the looks of it, does she not speak Japanese?
P: "Help me……! I dropped my phone……!"
P: "I see…… please tell me more."
P: Understanding why she was crying, I listened to her story.
P: Apparently, she came to Japan to visit a close friend but dropped her phone.
P: She realized it right after entering the shopping mall, and since she had it when she arrived at Okayama Station, she must have dropped it somewhere between the shopping mall and the station.
P: 
P: 　Since she couldn't speak Japanese and relied entirely on her smartphone for conversation, it seemed she was helpless without it.
P: 『Do you have any idea where it might be?』
P: 『*Sniff*... I looked, but I couldn't find it anywhere...』
P: 　In that case, it's highly likely that someone picked it up.
P: 『Where was the last place you remember using your phone?』
P: 　If she remembers having it at Okayama Station, she must have used it around that time.
P: 　We'll just have to start searching from there.
P: 『…………』
P: 　But for some reason, she turns her face away from me.
P: 　Does she have something to hide?
P: 『What's wrong?』
P: 『Um... do I have to say it...?』
P: 　The girl's cheeks turn slightly red as she looks up at me with upturned eyes.
P: 　Is it something difficult to say?
P: 『It would help if we had a clue...』
P: 『Yeah, you're right...』
P: 　She seems to agree, but she fidgets while pressing her index fingers together.
P: 　She's clearly embarrassed, so maybe it's something like――.
P: 『Um... the restroom...』
P: 　In a voice so small it was almost inaudible, the girl told me where she had last used her phone.
P: 　It matched my guess, and I regretted asking such an intrusive question.
P: 　No wonder she's embarrassed.
P: 『I'm sorry...』
P: 『No, it's my fault...』
P: 　An awkward atmosphere settles between us.
P: 　I never thought I'd feel this way with someone I just met.
P: 『Let's head back there for now』
P: 　I can't go in, of course, but it's fine if she does.
P: 　We'll just have to start searching from there.
P: 『But I already looked there...?』
P: 『Let's start from there and retrace your steps together』
P: 　Since we've already searched there, it's unlikely we'll find it, but there's always a chance we missed something.
P: 　She was probably panicking after losing her phone, so it's possible she overlooked something.
P: 『Okay, got it... Thank you』
P: 『No problem, we help each other out in times of need』
P: 　Fortunately, Emma is asleep, so it's no problem to spend some time looking for the phone.
P: 　As we were heading back to the station――.
P: 『By the way, we haven't introduced ourselves yet. I'm Olivia Kenny. You can call me Livvy』
P: 　Perhaps because she's from overseas, she's very friendly.
P: 　She came all the way to Japan to meet a friend, so she must have a lot of friends.
P: 『I'm Akihito Aoyagi. Nice to meet you』
P: 『Akihito...』
P: 　Upon hearing my name, her eyes widen for some reason.
P: 『Is something wrong?』
P: 『No, it's just that your name is the same as someone I know, so I thought it was a coincidence』
P: 　It seems she has a Japanese friend.
P: 　It's not a very common name, but I guess these things happen.
P: 『That must have been surprising. Did you come to meet that friend too?』
P: 『Well, not exactly a friend... but yeah, meeting him is one of the reasons I came to Japan』
P: 　She must really value her friends.
P: 『You seem to have a lot of friends, Livvy』
P: 『Ahaha, Livvy is a nickname, so you can just call me that. I'll call you Akihito too』
P: 　I'm not a fan of calling women by their first names, but... well, if it's a nickname, it's fine.
P: 『Besides, we're around the same age, right? You can be more casual with me』
P: 　She's really good at closing the distance.
P: 　Not only does she not make the other person uncomfortable, but she also makes them feel at ease. I guess this is what they call a social butterfly.
P: 　I wish I could teach this skill to Karen and Kosaka-san.
P: 『Well, I'll take you up on that offer. How long are you staying in Japan, Livvy?』
P: 『Hmm, about two weeks?』
P: 『That's quite a while』
P: 　I thought it would only be a few days, but maybe she has other plans?
P: 　I'd like to introduce her to Karen and have them become friends, but... since they don't speak each other's language, it might be difficult.
P: 『My school is on a long break, so I thought I'd do some sightseeing in Japan. Well, I lost my phone, so that plan's on hold for now』
P: 　Livvy suddenly looks distant and downcast.
P: 　She's lost her means of contacting her friends and her translation tool, so it's understandable.
P: 『That's why I'm lucky to have met you, Akihito. I was about to cry because I couldn't communicate at all』
P: 　Well, she was already crying... but I won't point that out.
P: 『Well, unlike Tokyo or Osaka, there aren't as many foreigners here, so there might not be many people who can speak English』
P: 　In places where many foreigners visit, there are usually staff who can speak English, but Okayama probably doesn't have many.
P: 　...Wait?
P: 『By the way, did you ask the station staff if anyone turned in your lost item?』
P: 『Huh?』
P: 　When I asked her about it, she tilted her head with a puzzled expression.
P: 　This must mean... she didn't ask.
P: 『You didn't ask, did you?』
P: 『Ah, ahaha... I was so shocked that I lost it, I just started searching...』
P: 　Just as I thought.
P: 　It wouldn't be strange if one or two station staff could speak English.
P: 　But since she said no one could understand her, I thought it was strange.
P: 『You said you already checked the restroom, so let's ask the station staff first』
P: 　So, when we went to ask the station staff――.
P: 『Found ittttttt!』
P: 　A kind person had turned in Livvy's phone to the station staff.
P: 『Thank you, Akihito!』
P: 『Whoa, wait!?』
P: 　Suddenly, she hugs me from the side, and I freeze in surprise.
P: 『Thank you so much! I thought it was gone for good!』
P: 『Ahaha... I'm glad. Can you let go now?』
P: 　Even though Charlotte and I are always affectionate, I'm not immune to girls in general.
P: 　Even though I know Livvy doesn't mean anything by it, I still feel embarrassed.
P: 　Plus, it would be bad if someone saw us like this.
P: 『Okay, okay, this is my thanks――*mwah*』
P: 　A sudden, soft sensation on my cheek.
P: 　It didn't take long for me to realize what it was.
P: 『What are you doing!?』
P: 『Ahaha, your face is all red. You're not used to this, are you?』
P: 　As I quickly step back, Livvy laughs happily.
P: 　She's way too friendly...!
P: 『You can't just do that casually in Japan...!』
P: 『Sorry, sorry. But I don't just do this with anyone, you know? This is the first time I've done it with someone other than a girl』
P: 『Then why did you do it to me...!?』
P: 『I told you, it's my thanks』
P: 　If she casually does something like this as thanks, I won't be able to handle it in more ways than one.
P: 『Please don't do something like this again...』
P: 『Okay, okay, you're such a shy guy～』
P: 　I want to ask if she really understands, but Livvy brushes it off lightly.
P: 　She's smiling and looking at me, so it doesn't seem like she gets it.
P: 『Hey, have you had lunch yet?』
P: 　Seemingly happy to have her phone back, Livvy cheerfully leans in closer.
P: 　Too close...
P: 『No, not yet...』
P: 　I take a small step back and shake my head.
P: 『Then let's go eat together! My treat!』
P: 　And then, Livvy casually closes the distance I had created.
P: 　This girl is really pushy...!
P: 『You already thanked me...』
P: 『Come on, show me a good place to eat!』
P: 　Thinking it's not good to be around someone so touchy, I try to refuse, but she grabs my sleeve.
P: 　It feels like she's saying she won't let me go.
P: 『I don't live around here, so I don't know any good places...』
P: 『Then let's find one together! Let's eat ramen, ramen!』
P: 　She's really pushy.
P: 　She probably won't let me go until I agree to go with her.
P: 　And then, when she said "ramen"――.
P: 『Ramen!?』
P: 　Emma, who had been sleeping in my arms, woke up.
P: 　She must have been in a light sleep because of our noise, but she's really got a big appetite.
P: 　And because she lifted her head so quickly, the hood she was wearing fell off.
P: 『Huh...?』
P: 　Seeing Emma's hair and face, Livvy realizes she's not Japanese and her eyes widen.
P: 『…………』
P: 　Livvy seems to have something on her mind as she stares at Emma.
P: 　Emma also tilts her head with a puzzled expression, blinking as she stares back.
P: 　But――.
P: 『Big brother, are we eating ramen?』
P: 　More interested in ramen than Livvy, Emma turns her gaze back to me and tilts her head again.
P: 　I quietly put the hood back on Emma's head and smile as I speak.
P: 『Do you want to eat ramen too, Emma?』
P: 『Mmm...!』
P: 　Emma seems to really like ramen, as she nods vigorously.
P: 　She probably wasn't hungry yet, but maybe ramen is a separate stomach.
P: 　At this point, we have no choice but to go eat ramen.
P: 　I don't think I can shake Livvy off now...
P: 　Livvy, meanwhile, looks at me with a suspicious expression, her hand on her mouth.
P: 『Um, what is it...?』
P: 『Is that girl... not your sister?』
P: 　She must be curious about Emma.
P: 　It's only natural.
P: 　If you see someone with a young child who looks nothing like them, you'd wonder about their relationship.
P: 　Well... it's better to be honest and avoid any misunderstandings.
P: 『This girl is my girlfriend's little sister. I'm taking care of her today』
P: 
P: 『...I knew it... What a coincidence, like something out of a manga...』
P: 
P: 　Hearing my words, Livvy mutters something under her breath.
P: 『Sorry, what did you say? I couldn't quite catch it』
P: 『Oh, it's nothing! Anyway, Emma wants to eat ramen too, so let's go!』
P: 　She brushes it off with a smile, even though I asked.
P: 　I wonder what she muttered?
P: 　Well, she's smiling, so it's probably nothing to worry about.
P: 　She even calls Emma by her name so naturally, even though I was the one who mentioned it. She really has great social skills.
P: 『Big brother, ramen...!』
P: 『See, she's eager to eat! Let's go, let's go!』
P: 　Livvy pushes me from behind, her voice cheerful.
P: 『Wait, you don't have to push me...!』
P: 『Ahaha, I thought today was going to be the worst, but it turned out to be the best!』
P: 『Why are you suddenly in such a good mood!?』
P: 『It's fine, it's fine!』
P: 　I don't really get it, but Livvy, who's suddenly in a great mood, pushes me as we leave the station.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: 『――Huh, so this is a popular place?』
P: 　When we arrived at the popular Tokushima Ramen shop that everyone at school talks about, Livvy looked up at the sign happily.
P: 　Honestly, if it's popular among students, there's a high chance of running into someone I know, but――Emma really likes ramen.
P: 　If we went to a place I didn't know and she ended up not liking the food, she might not want to eat ramen again, so I chose a popular place.
P: 『――Emma wants to press...!』
P: 　When I tried to buy ramen from the ticket machine, Emma wanted to press the buttons.
P: 　So I put in the money and let her press the buttons for my order and hers.
P: 　Livvy wanted to pay, but I politely declined.
P: 『Huh, is Emma going to eat a full portion?』
P: 『Normally she doesn't eat that much, but she can eat a full portion of ramen』
P: 『Wow, ramen is really delicious, huh? Emma, you can press the button for mine too』
P: 　Livvy puts in the money and smiles at Emma.
P: 　But――.
P: 『No』
P: 　Emma, seemingly uninterested, turns her head away.
P: 　She only wanted to press the buttons for our orders.
P: 『Ahaha, she's still the same...』
P: 『Huh?』
P: 　An unexpected comment slips out of Livvy's mouth, and I stare at her.
P: 『Ah, no, it's nothing』
P: 　But she brushes it off with a smile.
P: 　Did I mishear her...?
P: 　I thought she said "still the same"...
P: 『Well then, let's take a seat――』
P: 「――Oh, looks like there's a seat」
P: 　Just as Livvy points to an empty seat, the door opens and two girls walk in.
P: 　――It's Shimizu-san and Kosaka-san.
P: 「「「…………」」」
P: 　Shimizu-san smiles at me, while Kosaka-san frowns and glares.
P: 　I freeze, unsure of what to say to the two of them.
P: 　This timing... they must have been following us.
P: 『What's wrong, Akihito? Let's sit down』
P: 　Livvy, unaware of the situation, tugs at my sleeve.
P: 　I should probably explain, right...?
P: 　But Shimizu-san's smile is too terrifying, and I can't find the words.
P: 「Big brother, what's wrong? Your companion wants to sit down」
P: 　Shimizu-san speaks to me in a polite, almost formal tone.
P: 　She's pretending not to know me.
P: 　Her consideration is actually scary.
P: 『Big brother, hurry...!』
P: 『Y-yeah...』
P: 　Urged by Emma, I reluctantly take a seat.
P: 　I'll have to figure out what to do before we leave the shop.
P: 　Since I don't know how much they saw, it's better not to lie.
P: 　Lying would just make it seem like I have something to hide.
P: 　It's better to make sure they understand that I have no ulterior motives.
P: 「「…………」」
P: 　The two of them are sitting at a table away from us, but they're still staring at us.
P: 　I feel like I'm being watched.
P: 『――Akihito, are you okay? You're sweating a lot』
P: 　I must have been sweating without realizing it, as Livvy uses a napkin to wipe my forehead.
P: 　She's pushy, but she's not a bad person.
P: 　But――thanks to that, the two girls watching us are glaring even harder.
P: 　Since she's just being kind, I can't say anything to her, but...
P: 『Emma wants to wipe...!』
P: 　And then, for some reason, Emma starts to feel competitive.
P: 　Well, she probably just wanted to do it too.
P: 『She's really attached to you, even though she's your girlfriend's sister』
P: 　Livvy asks, watching Emma wipe my sweat.
P: 『I think it's because we spend a lot of time together』
P: 『Hmm?』
P: 　She doesn't seem convinced.
P: 　But there's no need to explain in detail.
P: 『Hey, is your girlfriend cute?』
P: 　Now Livvy seems interested in my girlfriend.
P: 『Of course she's cute. I'd even say she's too cute』
P: 　To me, no girl is cuter than Charlotte.
P: 　Of course, Emma is in a different category.
P: 『Wow, you're really confident! Do you have a picture?』
P: 『I do, but I can't show you』
P: 　I can't just show Charlotte's face without her permission.
P: 『You're so stingy～. Then tell me what she's like!』
P: 『Why?』
P: 『I want to know! If she's your girlfriend, I think I could be friends with her too!』
P: 　This must be how Livvy makes friends.
P: 　Introducing Charlotte to another girl is risky, but having a friend her age who speaks the same language could be good for her.
P: 　Even though her Japanese is good, speaking a foreign language all the time must be stressful... this could help her relax.
P: 『To put it simply, she's polite, elegant, kind to everyone, cute, and a bit of a spoiled girlfriend』
P: 　I don't usually talk about her like this, but the words come out easily.
P: 　Maybe it's because I always think of her that way.
P: 『Akihito, you're usually shy, but you talk about your girlfriend so easily』
P: 　Livvy tilts her head with a mischievous smile.
P: 　She's teasing me.
P: 『I'm just stating the facts』
P: 『Huh, you're so confident. I like that about you』
P: 　Suddenly, Livvy smiles warmly and stares at me.
P: 　The teasing atmosphere from before is gone, so maybe she was testing me.
P: 　I don't know why she was testing me, though.
P: 『Your girlfriend must feel reassured, having a boyfriend who praises her so much』
P: 『I wonder? She gets pretty jealous sometimes』
P: 『And now you're at a ramen shop with another girl?』
P: 　Livvy tilts her head again, looking amused.
P: 　Maybe she wasn't testing me earlier, and this is just part of her personality.
P: 『What are you two...?』
P: 　Thanks to her, I'm still being glared at by the two girls...
P: 『Ahaha, sorry, sorry. I just wanted to talk to you more』
P: 　I don't feel bad when she says that.
P: 　It's because her kindness feels genuine, even though it's not romantic.
P: 「Here you go――」
P: 　As we talk, the ramen arrives.
P: 　Since there's a young child, they also brought a small bowl and a child-sized fork.
P: 『It'll get soggy, so let's eat』
P: 『Yeah』
P: 　After Livvy nods, I turn to Emma.
P: 　Emma is staring at the ramen with sparkling eyes, fidgeting as if she can't wait to eat.
P: 『I'll put some in a bowl for you, so wait a second』
P: 　I put some noodles and soup into a small bowl for her.
P: 『Here you go. Eat slowly, it's hot』
P: 『Mmm, thank you...!』
P: 　Emma excitedly takes the bowl and immediately stabs her fork into it.
P: 『Hoo! Hoo!』
P: 　She blows on the noodles with all her might.
P: 　She knows how to eat hot food properly.
P: 『Yummy...!』
P: 　Emma's face relaxes as she eats the noodles, looking satisfied.
P: 　The flavor is completely different from the tomato ramen she had before, but she seems to like this one too.
P: 『Mmm, ramen is the best! I decided I had to eat it when I came to Japan!』
P: 　Livvy also looks happy as she eats.
P: 　She must really love ramen too.
P: 　In terms of taste, I made the right choice.
P: 　...Well, even if I had chosen a different place, Shimizu-san and the others would have followed us...
P: 『Can I add this spicy-looking bean sprouts?』
P: 　Livvy points to the pile of bean sprouts mixed with chili peppers on the table.
P: 『Yeah, those are fine』
P: 　When the shop was being talked about at school, everyone said they added these spicy bean sprouts to their ramen.
P: 　They're a free side dish, and they're supposed to taste similar to namul, which is delicious.
P: 『Then I'll try adding some』
P: 　Livvy adds some of the spicy bean sprouts to her ramen.
P: 『…………』
P: 　Emma, curious, watches her intently.
P: 『Do you want to try some, Emma?』
P: 　Noticing Emma's interest, Livvy shows her the bowl of bean sprouts.
P: 　But――.
P: 『Mmm, no』
P: 　Emma shakes her head.
P: 『She probably won't eat it because it looks spicy』
P: 　Emma, being young, doesn't like spicy food yet.
P: 　Seeing the red color, she must have decided it's spicy.
P: 『Too bad. Akihito, do you want some?』
P: 『Sure, I'll take some. Thanks』
P: 　I take the bowl and add a few bean sprouts to my ramen.
P: 『…………』
P: 　Emma, still curious, watches me.
P: 　She must be interested when she sees someone else adding them.
P: 『Want to try one?』
P: 　I put a single bean sprout on a small plate for her.
P: 　Emma looks at the bean sprout and then at me, before nodding.
P: 　And then――
P: 『Spicy...!』
P: 　――It was too spicy for her.
P: 『Drink some water』
P: 『Mmm...!』
P: 　I hand her a glass, and Emma drinks it down quickly.
P: 　It must have been really spicy for her.
P: 　I try a bite too, and while it's a bit spicy, it's not too bad.
P: 　I guess it's just too much for a young child.
P: 『…………』
P: 　Emma starts eating her ramen silently.
P: 　She must have decided not to add the bean sprouts.
P: 『――Mmm...!』
P: 　After finishing what was in her bowl, Emma holds it out to me.
P: 　She's asking for more.
P: 『Here you go』
P: 　I add more noodles to her bowl and hand it back.
P: 　I notice her mouth is a bit messy from the soup.
P: 『Emma, should I wipe your mouth?』
P: 『Mmm...!』
P: 　Emma stops eating and leans forward, offering her mouth.
P: 　I use a tissue to gently wipe her mouth.
P: 『There, all clean』
P: 『Thank you...!』
P: 　Emma thanks me and goes back to eating her ramen with gusto.
P: 　It's heartwarming to watch.
P: 『...Man, you're too good...』
P: 　Livvy, who had been silently watching us, mutters something.
P: 『Did you say something?』
P: 『Akihito, are you always like this?』
P: 　When I ask, she turns the question back to me.
P: 『Like what?』
P: 『Do you always take care of kids like this?』
P: 　I wonder how I look in Livvy's eyes.
P: 『Well, more or less』
P: 『Mmm, big brother is nice...!』
P: 　When I answer, Emma, who had been quiet during the conversation with Livvy, nods proudly.
P: 『I see, I see, that's good』
P: 『Mmm...!』
P: 　Livvy smiles at her, and Emma nods vigorously again.
P: 　I thought Emma might not get along with Livvy because of her energetic personality, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
P: 　Maybe she was just shy around strangers.
P: 　The atmosphere between Emma and Livvy softens, and we continue eating our ramen together.
P: 　Of course, some people at other tables are still glaring at us.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: 『――Ahh... that was delicious!』
P: 　As we leave the shop, Livvy holds her stomach, looking satisfied.
P: 『Mmm, it was yummy...!』
P: 　Emma seems to feel the same way, nodding in agreement.
P: 　Both of them look happy.
P: 『Well――thank you, Akihito. Thanks to you, I had a great time』
P: 　Livvy spins around and smiles cutely as she thanks me.
P: 　I thought she might drag me around some more, but...
P: 　Actually, I'd prefer if she didn't let me go just yet.
P: 『I'm glad too. It was an unexpected meeting, but I enjoyed talking with you』
P: 　But if I try to keep her around, the other two might misunderstand, so it's better to part ways here.
P: 『――Hey, Akihito』
P: 　As Livvy starts walking towards Okayama Station, she suddenly stops and calls my name.
P: 『Hmm?』
P: 『Before we go, can you tell me one thing?』
P: 　She turns around and looks at me with a serious expression.
P: 『What is it?』
P: 『What does your girlfriend mean to you?』
P: 　I don't know why Livvy is asking this.
P: 　But――the words come out almost reflexively.
P: 
P: 『She's irreplaceable, someone very precious to me』
P: 
P: 　When I answer honestly, Livvy smiles.
P: 『I'm glad I met you today. Well then, see you』
P: 　Livvy walks away, looking satisfied.
P: 　She was friendly, but also a bit mysterious.
P: 　Well, we should――
P: 「――Oh, where do you think you're going?」
P: 　As I try to hurry away from the shop, someone grabs my shoulder from behind.
P: 　I turn around to see Shimizu-san standing there with a charming smile.
P: 「Care to explain this situation?」
P: 　Next to her is Kosaka-san, looking displeased, holding up her phone.
P: 　On the screen――is a photo of me being kissed by Livvy.
P: 　They must have seen it after all.
P: 「Well, that was――」
P: 　I explain everything that happened.
P: 　Of course, I also explain the kiss in detail.
P: 　They seem to understand that Livvy is just a friendly girl and that there were no romantic feelings involved.
P: 「Be careful, okay? You'll make Charlotte sad」
P: 「Even you, Akihito-senpai, if you make Charlotte-senpai cry, I won't forgive you」
P: 　Being scolded by my classmate and underclassman, all I can do is nod.
P: 「I won't tell Charlotte...」
P: 「Of course you won't, it could lead to a huge misunderstanding」
P: 「Especially since you were caught by such a pretty girl」
P: 　The two of them sigh in unison.
P: 　I can't argue back.
P: 　I don't regret helping someone in need, but I should have been more careful not to get swept up in Livvy's pace.
P: 「By the way, was that really your first time meeting her? You seemed pretty close」
P: 「Like I said, she's just a friendly person」
P: 「People from overseas are really something... I wish I could be like that too...」
P: 　Kosaka-san tilts her head, seemingly unable to imagine herself acting like Livvy.
P: 「I couldn't do it either. I mean, I couldn't kiss a guy I just met」
P: 　Shimizu-san says this while showing me the photo on her phone again.
P: 　She's definitely teasing me.
P: 「Please delete that」
P: 　If Charlotte sees it by accident, it would be a disaster.
P: 「You should probably delete it」
P: 「Tch, and I finally had some dirt on Aoyagi-kun」
P: 　Shimizu-san pouts as she deletes the photo.
P: 　It seems the phone Kosaka-san was holding was Shimizu-san's.
P: 　After that, I parted ways with the two of them and spent a calm afternoon with Emma, visiting a sports shop and looking at stuffed animals.
H1: Chapter 6　"The Beautiful Exchange Student Can't Wait"
P: 
P: 
P: Finally, it arrived—December 24th, Christmas Eve.
P: Today was also the last day of school, so the school was bustling with energy from the morning.
P: After the closing ceremony ended and we were dismissed in the morning, the classroom turned into a festive chaos.
P: "Guys, we're having a Christmas party...!"
P: Akira was also in a strange, excited mood.
P: It seems the youth team he belongs to is also taking a break from practice starting today, so it’s perfect timing.
P: "I want to join too~!"
P: "Me too~!"
P: It seems that not only single guys but also girls and couples are joining the Christmas party.
P: And of course—
P: "Charlotte, you're coming too, right?"
P: The popular Charlotte was inevitably invited.
P: "Ah, um..."
P: Charlotte hesitated and glanced at me.
P: We hadn’t properly discussed our plans for later.
P: But we probably both felt the same way.
P: "Sorry, it’s our first Christmas Eve together, so I’d like to spend it just the two of us," I said, pulling Charlotte closer and apologizing to the girl who invited her.
P: "Oh~, you’re as passionate as ever~!"
P: "Okay, okay, go ahead and be lovey-dovey~!"
P: The girls smirked as they watched us.
P: Unlike when Charlotte first arrived, now even when I step in, no one says anything mean.
P: In fact, they seem to welcome it, and often tease us warmly.
P: "Ugh, I can’t stand this...!"
P: "Aoyagi, you’re always so lucky...!"
P: Well, the guys were practically crying tears of blood in frustration.
P: But I can’t blame them—Charlotte is just too cute.
P: "Spending Christmas Eve alone together, huh~?"
P: Amidst this, Shimizu-san approached us with a smirk.
P: "You look like you have something to say?"
P: "Good luck, boy."
P: When I spoke to her, she gave me a thumbs-up.
P: Yeah, she definitely knows.
P: "We’re just going to relax, that’s all."
P: "Y-yes! We’re just going to relax!"
P: Charlotte nodded desperately, agreeing with my words.
P: Her face was bright red, and she was clearly flustered, making it look like she was confessing something.
P: I had expected this, which is why I hadn’t brought it up until today—but it seems Charlotte had the same idea from the start.
P: "Charlotte,"
P: Shimizu-san poked Charlotte’s shoulder with her finger.
P: Then, she leaned in close to her ear—
P: "It’s Christmas Eve, so make it a good memory,"
P: —and whispered something.
P: "!"
P: Immediately, Charlotte let out an incoherent sound and squirmed.
P: I couldn’t hear what was said, but I could guess from Charlotte’s reaction.
P: Probably something about tonight.
P: "Oh, so those two are finally doing it..."
P: "Charlotte is finally..."
P: "They both seemed so shy, but I guess not..."
P: The girls watching us seemed to have figured it out too.
P: It’s embarrassing to have our classmates know about it.
P: "Ah... My Charlotte is finally going to be defiled by Aoyagi..."
P: "She’s not yours, but yeah, it’s still shocking..."
P: The guys also noticed and were visibly depressed.
P: At this rate, it’s going to spread throughout the whole school...?
P: "Um, it’s really not like that...!?"
P: "We know, we know."
P: Charlotte didn’t seem to realize that everyone knew, and she desperately tried to explain to Shimizu-san.
P: Shimizu-san listened with a smile, but she seemed to brush it off, so it didn’t seem to have any effect.
P: "—Everyone... what’s all the commotion about...?"
P: Karin, who couldn’t read the room, approached nervously.
P: She’s such an innocent girl, so she probably doesn’t understand what’s going to happen tonight.
P: "Don’t worry about it,"
P: I said with a smile, brushing it off. I want my little sister to stay pure forever.
P: "Really...?"
P: Karin tilted her head in confusion but didn’t press further.
P: She seems to trust what I say.
P: "More importantly, you’re coming tomorrow, right?"
P: Since today is Christmas Eve, tomorrow is Charlotte’s birthday.
P: So, we’re inviting close friends to her new house for a birthday party.
P: Kanon-san had suggested using a hall at a hotel owned by the Himezaki conglomerate and inviting all her acquaintances, but that would have made things too hectic for Charlotte.
P: We didn’t want her to have such a stressful time on her birthday, so we decided to celebrate with just close friends.
P: "Mm, I’ll come...! I even bought a present...!"
P: Karin, who is close with Charlotte, nodded proudly.
P: She probably wants praise for preparing so well.
P: "Yeah, thanks. I’ll pick you up at the station tomorrow."
P: "Your house changed, right...?"
P: I had told her when we moved so she wouldn’t go to the old house by mistake.
P: So, it’s natural that she knows, but—the atmosphere feels a bit off.
P: "Shinonome-san?"
P: Karin looked down, so I called out to her, concerned.
P: Then, she took out her phone and started typing a message.
P: When she finished, a notification sound came from my phone.
P: Looking at the screen—
P: 《So, it’s okay for other people to live with you, but not your little sister?》
P: It was an unusual message from Karin, filled with resentment.
P: After refusing her request to live together, I ended up living with Kanon-san and the others, so she seems to hold a grudge.
P: 《I explained the reason, right?》
P: When I explained it to Akira and Shimizu-san, I naturally called Karin too.
P: She should have understood, but...
P: 《I understand in my head, but I can’t accept it in my heart...》
P: It seems she understands but can’t bring herself to accept it.
P: Karin looked up and puffed out her cheeks at me.
P: Her odd eyes, visible through her bangs, looked dissatisfied.
P: It’s kind of cute that my little sister is sulking because she wants to live with me, but...
P: 《You can come over anytime once things settle down.》
P: I didn’t want her to stay upset, so I brought up the promise we made earlier.
P: Winter break starts tomorrow, so it’s a good opportunity.
P: Charlotte would probably be happy to have a sleepover too.
P: 《I don’t know the new big sister...》
P: The new big sister refers to Kanon-san.
P: Since she’s going to be my sister, Karin probably thinks of her as her sister too.
P: Kanon-san also knows about Karin and has said before that she wants to meet her, since she’s like a little sister to her too.
P: But for Karin, who’s shy around strangers, staying at a house with someone she hasn’t met before seems like a high hurdle.
P: 《She’s a kind person, and I’ll be there too, but if you’re not comfortable, it’s okay to say no.》
P: I can’t force her, and if Karin doesn’t want to stay over, that’s fine too.
P: 《Umm, I’ll stay...》
P: But it seems she does want to stay over.
P: 《Then, let me know when you want to stay over.》
P: 《What about tomorrow?》
P: Karin seems to want to stay over as soon as possible, asking if tomorrow is okay.
P: I get that since she’s coming over, it would make sense to stay, but—
P: 《Sorry, tomorrow I want to focus on Charlotte, so let’s do it another day.》
P: If another girl is there until night, Charlotte might feel awkward.
P: It’s her birthday, so I don’t want her to feel uncomfortable, and I also want to spoil her just the two of us.
P: Besides, if Karin stays over tomorrow, Shimizu-san and Kosaka-san, who are also coming, might decide to stay over too.
P: It would turn into a girls’ night, and that would be awkward for me.
P: 《Okay...》
P: 《Another day is fine.》
P: Karin visibly deflated, so I tried to reassure her.
P: "—Why are you texting when we’re right in front of each other?"
P: Suddenly, Akira slung an arm over my shoulder from behind.
P: He must have been watching us, as he even noticed the texting.
P: "We were talking about something I didn’t want you to hear. You’re coming tomorrow, right?"
P: "Yeah, of course. But are you sure it’s okay for me to come?"
P: Akira had been actively pursuing Charlotte, but it didn’t go well.
P: Charlotte is a bit scared of guys and puts up an invisible wall, so Akira probably felt like he was being avoided.
P: Even though we eat lunch together, he seems hesitant to go to her birthday party.
P: "If you don’t come, I’ll feel out of place..."
P: The attendees tomorrow are close in age, but it’s just Kanon-san, Shimizu-san, Kosaka-san, and Karin.
P: On top of that, Kaguraya-san and Sophia-san are also coming, so it’s mostly girls.
P: At least if there’s one guy, I won’t feel out of place.
P: "Well, that’s true, but... you didn’t invite any other guys, right?"
P: "Sorry, I don’t have many friends."
P: "N-no, that’s not what I meant...!"
P: Akira frantically shook his head.
P: Unfortunately, Akira is the only guy I can trust.
P: If I invited someone else and they made Charlotte uncomfortable, it would be a problem.
P: I thought about inviting Riku as thanks for last time, but Shimizu-san didn’t like the idea, so I didn’t.
P: She argued that since he hadn’t talked much with the other attendees, he would just feel out of place.
P: She seemed determined not to let him join.
P: "Aoyagi-kun, you don’t have many friends either...?"
P: "Don’t look at me like you’ve found a comrade..."
P: Karin looked at me with a happy expression, so I could only smile wryly.
P: But honestly, most of my friends are girls, and the only guys I’m close with are Akira and Riku...
P: Maybe I’m just a weird guy in everyone’s eyes...?
P: "By the way, Shinonome-san, aren’t you coming to the Christmas party today?"
P: Akira, learning from past mistakes, spoke gently to Karin.
P: "Ah... If Aoyagi-kun and Charlotte aren’t going... then I won’t..."
P: But Karin refused, just like she did at Charlotte’s welcome party.
P: She probably thinks she won’t have anyone to talk to.
P: Shimizu-san is going to the Christmas party, but since they don’t eat lunch together, Karin still hasn’t warmed up to her.
P: Plus, Shimizu-san, who has many friends, will probably be surrounded by them, so it’s unlikely Karin will be able to talk to her.
P: "I think it’s good to join these kinds of events. If anything happens, Akira will back you up."
P: As an older brother, I’m a bit worried about letting her join such gatherings, but since Akira and Shimizu-san are there, nothing bad should happen.
P: Even if it’s hard to talk to people, Shimizu-san will keep an eye out to make sure nothing weird happens.
P: It’s a good opportunity, so I wanted her to join and grow a bit.
P: But—
P: "Umm, it’s okay..."
P: Karin still doesn’t want to join.
P: "My lack of credibility..."
P: Akira, thinking he’s being disliked, looked shocked and slumped his shoulders.
P: "No, I don’t think that’s it... She just doesn’t want to join because she doesn’t have anyone to talk to."
P: "Mm..."
P: When I added that, Karin nodded.
P: If she doesn’t have anyone to talk to, she’ll just have an uncomfortable time, so it’s understandable that she’s hesitant.
P: "What about asking Kosaka-san to join...? That’s probably too much, huh?"
P: As soon as I mentioned her name, Akira made a disgusted face, so I corrected myself.
P: "Akihito, you really suggest the wildest things."
P: "Well, it’s kind of sad to have a second-year join, right?"
P: I’d like her to be Karin’s conversation partner, but Kosaka-san is also the type to be shy around strangers, so she’d probably hate joining a second-year gathering.
P: Once she gets used to people, she’s polite and nice, but...
P: "Besides, I don’t get along with her."
P: "Really?"
P: "Why are you tilting your head...? We argue all the time, don’t we?"
P: Akira looked annoyed, but from an outsider’s perspective, their arguments just look like playful banter.
P: "Well, if you’re not inviting her, that’s fine. Shinonome-san, you’re really not joining?"
P: "Mm..."
P: I asked one last time, but her answer didn’t change.
P: Since I’m not joining either, I can’t push her too hard.
P: "Well, I’m going home with Charlotte now."
P: Currently, Charlotte is surrounded by Shimizu-san and the other girls, being teased relentlessly.
P: I should probably save her soon, or she’ll feel bad.
P: "See you both tomorrow."
P: "Yeah, see you."
P: "Bye..."
P: I said goodbye to the two of them and headed into the circle of girls.
P: "Charlotte—"
P: "A-kun, help me...!"
P: When I reached the center, Charlotte, her face bright red and teary-eyed, clung to me tightly.
P: "Um..."
P: "Everyone’s being mean...!"
P: Charlotte pressed her face against me.
P: She must have been really embarrassed.
P: I could tell from a distance that they were teasing her about tonight.
P: Charlotte’s cute reactions probably made the girls lose control.
P: "Ahaha... Sorry, Charlotte, Aoyagi-kun."
P: Shimizu-san, the main culprit, scratched her cheek and apologized.
P: "It’s too much if she’s uncomfortable with it."
P: I gently patted Charlotte’s head and scolded the girls.
P: The girls seemed more interested in my actions than my words.
P: "He’s so bold, hugging her and patting her head like that..."
P: "Aoyagi-kun has this mature confidence..."
P: "He started patting her so naturally, do they always act like this...?"
P: "Honestly, I’m kind of jealous of Charlotte..."
P: The girls, their cheeks red, stared at us intently.
P: I feel like we’re going to become a topic of conversation for a different reason.
P: "Charlotte, let’s go home, okay?"
P: "Yes..."
P: I didn’t want to stay under their gaze, so I called out to Charlotte, and she nodded slightly.
P: Her face was still pressed against me, so she couldn’t look at anyone.
P: She seems knowledgeable, but she’s shy, so she’s weak when it comes to nighttime topics.
P: I led her to her desk, and Charlotte picked up her bag.
P: I did the same at my desk, and we headed out into the hallway.
P: "Charlotte, you need to let go now..."
P: There were obviously students from other classes in the hallway, and if they saw us, we’d just look like a lovey-dovey couple who couldn’t wait for night.
P: It’s not good for rumors to spread, especially with the teachers.
P: I don’t know what Miyu-sensei would say.
P: "—Ah, Akihito-senpai, Charlotte-senpai, are you heading home?"
P: As Charlotte let go, a voice called out from above as we were about to go down the stairs.
P: Looking up, I saw Nikaido-san and some first-year girls looking at us.
P: They must have just come down from the first-year hallway.
P: "Yeah, are you all going out to play?"
P: "Yes, we’re having a girls-only Christmas party. Charlotte-senpai, you’re so lucky to have a wonderful boyfriend like Akihito-senpai."
P: Nikaido-san looked at Charlotte with envy.
P: She must be at that age where she wants a boyfriend.
P: "Thank you. A-kun is really wonderful."
P: Charlotte casually linked her arm with mine again.
P: Is she trying to show off that he’s hers?
P: "Ahaha... Don’t worry, I won’t make a move. You two are such a great couple, we’re all rooting for you."
P: Nikaido-san seemed to interpret Charlotte’s actions the same way I did and laughed awkwardly.
P: Come to think of it, Kosaka-san mentioned before that we’re a popular couple among the first-years.
P: Are we being watched like some kind of couple channel on a video streaming site?
P: "Himeka-chan is so unfair...! I want to talk to you two too...!"
P: "Me too!"
P: "I want to take a photo with you!"
P: The first-year girls reacted as if they’d met celebrities.
P: We’ve become somewhat famous at this school due to various incidents, but I don’t think we’re that special.
P: —But it’s convenient that the first-years are so fond of us.
P: I led them outside the school building so as not to disturb the other students.
P: The first-years seemed to have misunderstood and followed us, squealing excitedly, but I didn’t plan to take photos with them.
P: I just wanted to talk and make a request.
P: "Nikaido-san, you’re in the same class as Kosaka-san, right?"
P: "Eh, yes, but...?"
P: When I mentioned Kosaka-san, Nikaido-san visibly tensed.
P: The other girls also looked suspicious, clearly unhappy with the mention of Kosaka-san.
P: This was within my expectations.
P: "A-kun, what are you...?"
P: Charlotte, sensing the tension, tried to stop me.
P: So, I smiled reassuringly and turned back to Nikaido-san.
P: "Do you not get along with Kosaka-san?"
P: I asked gently, making it clear I wasn’t hostile.
P: "I know that Kosaka-san often spends time with Akihito-senpai and the others..."
P: Unfortunately, we’ve become somewhat famous at this school.
P: That means we’re being watched, and information about the people around us is being shared.
P: And Kosaka-san, who’s the only first-year spending time with us, isn’t well-liked by some students.
P: She’s always had trouble fitting in, and lately, she’s been even more isolated.
P: We’ve been letting her join our group so she doesn’t feel lonely until she makes friends, but if that’s backfiring, we need to address it.
P: "But honestly... we don’t get along."
P: From my previous interactions, Nikaido-san seemed like an honest girl.
P: She’s straightforward about her feelings, so my assessment wasn’t wrong.
P: This kind of person would get along well with Kosaka-san.
P: "Why is that?"
P: "Um..."
P: Nikaido-san fidgeted with her fingers, her gaze wandering.
P: The other girls also looked away awkwardly.
P: "I just want to know, so feel free to say what you think."
P: I wasn’t here to scold or complain.
P: I just wanted to mediate between Nikaido-san and Kosaka-san.
P: To do that, I needed to know how Nikaido-san felt.
P: Kosaka-san, on the other hand, seems to like Nikaido-san because she’s been spreading positive things about me and Charlotte.
P: "She’s blunt and says harsh things directly... and she’s too serious, which makes her hard to approach."
P: "......"
P: As Nikaido-san spoke, Charlotte stared at me intently.
P: She must be thinking that Kosaka-san is similar to someone else.
P: Well, in my case, I was deliberately trying to make people dislike me.
P: "Even if it’s the truth, she should think about how she says it, right?"
P: "Yes..."
P: Nikaido-san nodded apologetically.
P: It seems the way Kosaka-san speaks is the main issue.
P: She probably feels guilty because she knows I’m close with Kosaka-san.
P: "Just because we’re close—you might think that, but Kosaka-san is actually a kind and nice girl. She’s just shy and doesn’t know how to act around people she’s not used to, so she comes off as cold."
P: First, I needed to let Nikaido-san know more about Kosaka-san.
P: That’s the first step.
P: "Akihito-senpai, did you go to the same middle school as Kosaka-san...?"
P: "Yeah, we were in the same middle school and club. So, I probably understand her better than anyone else at this school."
P: When I said that, Charlotte tightened her grip on my arm.
P: She probably didn’t like the way I phrased it.
P: "So, you’re approaching me for Kosaka-san’s sake, right?"
P: Maybe because she’s an influencer, she caught on quickly.
P: "In her case, misunderstandings have created a gap, and I want to close that. Getting along with Kosaka-san would be good for you too."
P: Kosaka-san is serious and can be strict at times, but she’ll never abandon someone in need.
P: If Nikaido-san ever has trouble, Kosaka-san will definitely help her.
P: But—
P: "Kosaka-san...?"
P: "You don’t think so...?"
P: The girls behind Nikaido-san looked like they couldn’t believe my words.
P: They’ve probably clashed with her a few times already.
P: "......"
P: Nikaido-san stared at me intently, deep in thought.
P: Then—
P: "Okay, I’ll invite Kosaka-san to the Christmas party later."
P: She smiled.
P: "Himeka-chan!?"
P: "Are you serious!?"
P: "The atmosphere will definitely get awkward...!?"
P: The other girls panicked, not expecting Nikaido-san to agree.
P: I didn’t mean for her to invite Kosaka-san right away, so I was surprised too.
P: "We’ve been avoiding Kosaka-san just because she’s scolded us a few times, right? I think that wasn’t a good idea."
P: "That might be true, but..."
P: "Still..."
P: I don’t know what happened between Nikaido-san and Kosaka-san.
P: From Kosaka-san’s reaction, I thought there wasn’t a deep rift, but it seems there was some trouble.
P: But on the flip side, it’s just a minor conflict that Kosaka-san doesn’t even care about.
P: It’s something that can be fixed.
P: "I understand how everyone feels, and if Akihito-senpai hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t have thought about facing her. But I want to know more about her. Akihito-senpai and Charlotte-senpai are people I respect, and if they’re going out of their way for Kosaka-san, I want to see what kind of person she really is."
P: When the video incident happened, I thought she was a careless girl who didn’t think deeply about things, but talking to her now, she seems like someone who can think things through.
P: She’s just easily swayed by emotions, but she’s actually smart.
P: "Besides, since I’ve already caused trouble for Akihito-senpai and been helped by them, I can’t refuse a request."
P: She turned back to me, her serious demeanor gone, and gave a cute, playful smile.
P: She was probably trying to lighten the mood.
P: "Thank you, I appreciate it."
P: The other girls seemed to accept it, but they probably still have reservations.
P: If Nikaido-san is willing to face Kosaka-san, that’s enough.
P: "But has she already left...?"
P: Kosaka-san, who has no friends in her class, probably left the classroom as soon as homeroom ended.
P: It wouldn’t be surprising if she’s already gone, but...
P: "Is a phone call okay?"
P: "Eh... ah, yes."
P: After confirming, Nikaido-san nodded hesitantly.
P: I immediately called Kosaka-san on my phone.
P: 《—Yes, this is Kaede. What’s wrong?》
P: After a few rings, Kosaka-san answered.
P: "Sorry for calling suddenly. Are you free now?"
P: 《Yes, I’m waiting for the train at the station.》
P: It seems we’re still in time.
P: "Then, Nikaido-san has something to say. Can I pass the phone to her?"
P: 《Eh!? Why is Nikaido-san...!?》
P: She was clearly surprised to hear Nikaido-san’s name from me.
P: It’s understandable.
P: She probably never expected Nikaido-san to contact her through me.
P: "Is that okay?"
P: 《N-no, it’s fine...》
P: She sounded nervous, but she agreed to talk.
P: "Nikaido-san, can you take it from here?"
P: "Y-yes..."
P: Nikaido-san, also nervous, took the phone.
P: It must take courage to invite someone you don’t get along with.
P: "Um... hello, this is Nikaido... Actually—"
P: Nikaido-san invited Kosaka-san to the Christmas party happening later today.
P: I could hear Kosaka-san’s surprised voice through the phone, but she didn’t sound unwilling.
P: As they talked, Nikaido-san’s expression and tone gradually softened.
P: "—She said she’ll come."
P: After hanging up, Nikaido-san smiled and handed the phone back to me.
P: "She kept asking if it was really okay, huh?"
P: Nikaido-san had laughed and repeatedly assured her it was fine, so Kosaka-san must have been persistent in confirming.
P: But the fact that she didn’t refuse and kept asking—
P: "She probably didn’t expect to be invited, so she was worried. But once she realized it was okay—she was happy about the invitation."
P: Nikaido-san smiled happily as she explained.
P: It seems Kosaka-san really wanted to join.
P: I’m glad my meddling didn’t backfire.
P: "Kosaka-san was happy...?"
P: "We thought she definitely hated us..."
P: The girls behind Nikaido-san also looked surprised.
P: This should clear up at least one misunderstanding.
P: She’s just the type to say harsh things without hesitation, but she doesn’t actually want to fight with anyone.
P: In fact, she wants to get along, so she’s happy to be invited.
P: "She might still be a bit awkward, so if you could be patient with her until she gets used to it, I’d appreciate it."
P: "It’s okay, I’m good at socializing."
P: Seeing Kosaka-san’s happy reaction, Nikaido-san seemed to think she could get along with her.
P: She confidently assured me.
P: "Thank you. And sorry for taking up your time."
P: "No, no, thank you."
P: I didn’t expect to be thanked, but it’s probably just a polite gesture.
P: "Well, we’ll be going now. Have fun at the Christmas party."
P: "Okay, take care! Have a wonderful night, senpai!"
P: "—!?"
P: Charlotte reacted sharply to Nikaido-san’s joke.
P: The word "night" must have triggered her.
P: Her face turned bright red, and the first-years also blushed as they looked at us.
P: "Ah, ah~, I see. I meant it as a joke, but it’s serious..."
P: Even Nikaido-san blushed as she realized.
P: She awkwardly averted her gaze, and I felt a bit guilty.
P: "She’s just shy, so don’t worry about it."
P: I doubt they’ll believe that, but it’s all I could say.
P: 　It seems that by the beginning of the year, it will spread throughout the school.
P: 　Anyway, if things continue like this, it seems like we'll dig ourselves into a deeper hole, so we decided to say our goodbyes and leave quickly.
P: "――I see... The seniors are going to become adults..."
P: "Well, but it's a bit unexpected, isn't it...? Since Charlotte-senpai is so head over heels for Akihito-senpai, I thought they would have done it already..."
P: "She's such a kind senpai, coming to ask us for a favor like this for the sake of her juniors... It seems like she would be gentle when holding Charlotte-senpai too..."
P: "I don't know...? Maybe people like that surprisingly turn into wolves at night..."
P: "Charlotte-senpai being completely overwhelmed...?"
P: "「「「「…………」」」」
P: 　When I glanced back, the first-year students were looking at each other with red faces.
P: 　What are they talking about...?
P: 　Since Charu, who is clinging to my arm, has been squirming non-stop since earlier, it seems like they're talking about us...
P: 　I'm curious, but I can't make out what they're saying with my ears, so there's nothing I can do.
P: 　I can't go back and ask them either.
P: 　Anyway, judging by Charu's reaction, it doesn't seem like they're saying anything good.
P: 　Although I'm curious about what they're saying, I quickly leave for Charu's sake.
P: 
P: "「「「「I wonder what it would be like if those two did it... I'm curious...」」」」
P: 
P: 　――I felt a very intense gaze on my back.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "…………"
P: 　On the way back, Charu kept glancing up at my face but didn't say anything.
P: 　She must be curious about our plans for later but can't bring herself to ask.
P: 　All Charu knows is that we're not going to pick up Emma-chan and are heading straight home.
P: 　As for Emma-chan, Sophia-san will pick her up to give us some time.
P: 　When we arrived home――.
P: "There's no one here...?"
P: 　Normally, Kagura-san would be here at this time, but since it's the end-of-term ceremony for Kanon-san too, she must have gone to pick her up.
P: "…………"
P: 　Charu looked at me with an expectant, passionate gaze.
P: 　Maybe she wants to be spoiled since we're alone.
P: "Actually, Kanon-san told me that we don't have to go home today. Why don't we just change our clothes and go to the room we used to live in before?"
P: "――!"
P: 　As I hugged Charu and asked her, her face turned bright red, and she gasped.
P: 　I guess my intentions got through to her.
P: "Y-yes, I'll get ready right away...!"
P: 　Then, she hurriedly rushed back to her room.
P: 　She must be excited.
P: 　Since we share the same room, I waited by the door for Charu to finish changing.
P: "――Sorry to keep you waiting...!"
P: 　When Charu came out of the room, she wasn't wearing her usual casual T-shirt and pants.
P: 　She was wearing a black hoodie with a large white heart design on the chest and a cute pink mini-skirt.
P: 　Even though we weren't going out, she was dressed up, and it made me happy to see that she was conscious of what was coming next.
P: "That's a cute outfit."
P: "Hehe... Kanon-nee-san bought this for me when we went out together the other day."
P: 　Charu smiled cutely, showing off the heart design by spreading her clothes with both hands.
P: 　I think she's in a really good mood when she smiles like this.
P: 　That day, Kagura-san came back with a lot of paper bags, but all of them were filled with new clothes for Charu.
P: 　It seems that Kanon-san enjoyed dressing Charu up like a doll and, as a thank you, gave her a lot of clothes as gifts.
P: "That's great, it suits you well. I'll change quickly too, so wait for me in the living room, okay?"
P: 　As we switched places, I changed in the room and headed to the living room with the necessary items.
P: 　Charu was sitting on the living room sofa, fidgeting restlessly.
P: "Shall we go then?"
P: "Yes...!"
P: 　When I called out to her, Charu happily clung to me.
P: 　She naturally intertwined her fingers with mine, holding hands like lovers.
P: 　Not satisfied with just that, she hugged my right arm with her free hand and rested her head on my shoulder.
P: 　She's in full clingy mode.
P: 　For some reason, she's carrying a large bag, but it seems like a lot even for a change of clothes.
P: 　What could be inside?
P: "――What should we do for lunch? Should we eat out?"
P: 　As I locked the door and left the room, I asked about our lunch plans.
P: 　Since school ended in the morning, we haven't eaten anything yet.
P: 　Since it's Christmas Eve, I thought eating out might be better, but...
P: "I want to cook..."
P: 　It seems Charu wants to cook today as well.
P: "Do we still have the cooking utensils there?"
P: "Yeah, I left them there."
P: 　Since expensive cooking utensils had already been brought into this house, I left the ones Charu always used in the room.
P: "I want to stop by the supermarket."
P: "Yeah, we need to buy ingredients."
P: "...A-kun, you can go ahead to the room if you want."
P: "Huh?"
P: 　Surprised by her unexpected words, I looked at Charu's face.
P: 　I've never been told something like this before.
P: 　It's always been natural for us to go shopping together, and even the time spent shopping was happy.
P: "Am I in the way...?"
P: "N-no, that's not what I meant, just...!"
P: 　After hurriedly denying it, Charu turned her face away, looking embarrassed.
P: 　Is there something she finds hard to say...?
P: "Sorry, I don't want to leave you alone outside too much..."
P: 　If Charu wants to go shopping alone, I'd like to respect her feelings, but I don't want to leave her alone after she became famous because of the video.
P: 　Because something unexpected could happen.
P: "That's true..."
P: 　Charu seemed to agree and nodded slightly.
P: 　Her expression wasn't one of disappointment――but rather, she seemed embarrassed for some reason.
P: 　What was she planning to buy?
P: 　While wondering about it, I swallowed my words to avoid making Charu uncomfortable.
P: 　When we arrived at the supermarket――.
P: "This and this... and this too..."
P: 　It seemed Charu had already decided what to make, as she started putting vegetables into the basket one after another.
P: 　I silently carried the basket, but I had no idea what Charu was planning to make.
P: 　In the basket were vegetables like onions, leeks, and spinach――as well as main ingredients like oysters, eel, mackerel, beef, and pork.
P: 　Aside from ginger, she was even buying ingredients we don't usually buy, like okra and avocado. What is she planning to make...?
P: 　Also, even if she's buying for both lunch and dinner, the amount seems excessive...?
P: "This seems like it's going to be expensive, but is it okay...?"
P: 　Normally, if Emma-chan and I don't make any requests, Charu chooses inexpensive items and then thinks of a recipe, buying only what's necessary.
P: 　But this time, she's buying a lot of expensive ingredients.
P: "It's okay, I'll use my allowance."
P: "No, I'll pay half too."
P: 　Since we're both going to eat it, it's only natural that I pay half.
P: 　From the looks of it, Charu seems to be aware that she's buying expensive things.
P: "I'm the one who's buying whatever I want, so I'll pay."
P: 　However, perhaps thinking that buying these ingredients is her own selfishness, Charu shook her head.
P: "No, we have to do this properly. If it's something we're doing together, then――"
P: 　As I said that, I suddenly stopped.
P: 　If I say something like this, Charu might suggest splitting the bill on dates, and I wouldn't be able to argue against it.
P: 　I don't want to pay for everything, but there are times when I want to treat her.
P: 　If I can't do that anymore, it would be quite troublesome.
P: "I want to pay..."
P: 　As I was thinking, Charu looked up at me pleadingly.
P: 　For the sake of the future, it seems better to respect Charu's feelings here.
P: "I see, thank you. Then, next time we go on a date, let me pay, okay?"
P: 　This seems like the best compromise for now.
P: "Yes, I'll let you treat me then."
P: 　Charu smiled happily and nodded slightly.
P: 　She seems happy too, so this seems to have worked out.
P: 　After finishing the checkout――we headed back to the apartment we used to live in.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "――Please eat a lot."
P: 　With a warm smile, Charu showed me the dishes laid out on the table.
P: 　On the other hand, I was breaking out in a cold sweat.
P: 　It's not like she made anything strange.
P: 　But the amount is ridiculous.
P: 　On the table were oyster foil bake, oyster and bacon ajillo, oyster spinach gratin, and oyster aqua pazza――a full oyster menu.
P: 　Not only that, but there was also clam miso soup, scallop carpaccio, grilled eel, and salted mackerel――way too many side dishes for two people.
P: "Um, Charu...?"
P: "Yes, what is it?"
P: 　When I called out to her, she responded with a happy smile.
P: 　For a moment, I thought I might have upset her, but there was no sign of that.
P: 　Maybe she made a mistake with the amount since she's used to cooking for six people...?
P: 　No, she's not the type to make such a mistake, and she doesn't seem to be aware of it either.
P: 　She should know how much I eat――so why did this happen...?
P: "Ah, should we feed each other...?"
P: 　Seeing that I hadn't touched the side dishes, Charu moved closer to me.
P: 　Then, she pressed herself against me and looked up at me expectantly.
P: 　She must want to feed each other.
P: "What about dinner...?"
P: 　I asked, clinging to the last possibility.
P: "I'll make something different for dinner, so it's okay to eat everything now."
P: 　However, that hope was quickly dashed.
P: 　It seems this amount is for lunch.
P: 　I feel like her mood is a bit off, so maybe that's why...?
P: "Huff huff. Here, A-kun, say 'ahh'."
P: 　Charu picked up an oyster from the foil bake with her chopsticks, blew on it to cool it down, and brought it to my mouth.
P: 　Her excited demeanor is cute, but I wonder if my stomach can handle it...?
P: "Ahh... *munch*"
P: 　Not wanting to ruin Charu's mood, I ate the oyster.
P: "Is it delicious?"
P: "Yeah, it's as amazing as always."
P: 　There's no way something Charu made wouldn't be delicious.
P: 　I haven't eaten oysters much, and I thought they had a strong flavor, but they were really tasty.
P: "Then, next one please."
P: 　As Charu reached for the next dish with her chopsticks.
P: "Wait."
P: "Huh, what's wrong...?"
P: 　I grabbed Charu's hand to stop her, and she looked up at me in confusion.
P: "We're feeding each other, right? Next, I'll feed you."
P: 　Honestly, I'm a bit scared of letting Charu continue feeding me at her current pace.
P: 　The pace might be fine, but I feel like she'll keep feeding me endlessly even if I'm full.
P: 　And if Charu tries to feed me, I can't refuse.
P: 　At the very least, I want her to eat until she's full.
P: "Ah, that's true. Then..."
P: 　Charu seemed to only use one pair of chopsticks, so she handed me the ones she was using.
P: 　She doesn't seem to mind an indirect kiss.
P: "What do you want to eat?"
P: "Anything is fine, so you choose, A-kun."
P: 　Since Charu chose what to feed me earlier, she wants me to choose this time.
P: "Then..."
P: 　To avoid feeding her the same thing, I picked up a scallop with my chopsticks.
P: 　Seeing me pick it up, Charu closed her eyes and opened her mouth slightly.
P: 　I blew on the scallop to cool it down and fed it to Charu, who was waiting like a baby bird.
P: "Munch munch..."
P: 　Charu covered her mouth with her hand as she chewed.
P: 　Eventually, she swallowed――
P: "Hehe..."
P: 　――and smiled happily.
P: "What's up?"
P: "Haha... Sorry. This time is just so happy that I couldn't help it..."
P: 　While apologizing, Charu rested her head on my shoulder.
P: 　She must be in the mood to be spoiled.
P: "I'm really happy too."
P: 　Even though the amount of food in front of me is making me sweat, there's no way I could dislike this time alone with Charu.
P: 　My chest feels so warm, and I feel like I could forget all my worries.
P: "I'm glad..."
P: 　Charu rubbed her face against my arm.
P: 　I want to spoil her, but――the food will get cold.
P: 　We can cuddle as much as we want after eating, so let's hold off until then.
P: "We can take our time later, so let's finish eating first, okay?"
P: 　I gently patted Charu's head and smiled at her.
P: "――Ah. That's right..."
P: 　Charu's cheeks turned red, and she quickly turned her face away.
P: 　...Huh, why?
P: 　As I looked at Charu in confusion, she reached for the chopsticks I was holding.
P: 　When I handed them to her, she picked up some eel and brought it to my mouth.
P: "Here... say 'ahh'..."
P: 　As she said this, Charu's eyes were moist, as if she were in a feverish state.
P: 
P: ◆
P: 
P: "A-kun, are you okay...?"
P: 　As I sat on the sofa, Charu, who had finished cleaning up, came over to talk to me.
P: 　As for me, my stomach was so full that it felt like it was about to burst, and I couldn't move properly.
P: 　In the end, I managed to eat everything without leaving anything.
P: "I'll be fine after resting a bit..."
P: "I'm sorry, I made too much..."
P: 　Charu looked at me with a worried expression, seeming regretful.
P: "Ugh, it's just that everything was so delicious that I ate too much."
P: "A-kun..."
P: 　Seeing my smile, Charu seemed to relax and sat down next to me.
P: 　Then, as usual, she pressed herself against me.
P: "What about the bath...?"
P: 　The bath?
P: 　Ah, she's asking who will go in first tonight, right?
P: 　If that's the case, it's fine for Charu to go first as usual――but.
P: "…………"
P: 　Suddenly, I noticed Charu looking at me with a passionate gaze.
P: 　This is probably different...
P: 　She's asking if we should go in now.
P: "If you want to go in, you can go ahead."
P: 　I deliberately responded in a way that would make Charu realize the misunderstanding.
P: 　However――.
P: "T-together...? Is it too early for that...?"
P: 　Charu stepped on the gas even more.
P: 　Her upward glance and invitation made my head spin.
P: 　This is an unreasonable request to resist.
P: 　But I have a reason to wait until night...
P: "Then, shall we take a bath together tonight...?"
P: 　I had no choice but to respond like this.
P: "Huh?"
P: 　Charu tilted her head with a puzzled expression.
P: "…………"
P: 　She fell silent and started thinking about something.
P: "Ah...!? Uh, that...!"
P: 　This time, she seemed to have realized something and started panicking.
P: 　She probably realized that our thoughts were different.
P: 　Charu's beautiful face turned redder than I've ever seen before.
P: 　And then――.
P: "!"
P: 　She let out a soundless scream and ran away.
P: "Charu!?"
P: "Don't come after me...!"
P: 　When I hurriedly chased after her, Charu ran into the bedroom.
P: 　She even locked the door.
P: "What are you doing, open the door...!"
P: "N-no, this is different, really different...! It's not what you think...!"
P: 　She was desperately making excuses.
P: 　I have no idea what's different.
P: "Just come out...!"
P: "I can't...! *sob*... You must think I'm a perverted girl now...!"
P: 　Charu's voice was tearful.
P: 　As she called herself a perverted girl, it seems Charu was planning to do it before night.
P: 　That's why she brought up the bath even though it was too early.
P: "It's okay, I don't think that at all...!"
P: "You're lying...! A-kun is just being kind and considerate...!"
P: 　This incident must have been a huge shock for Charu.
P: 　She's shy, so she must be incredibly embarrassed.
P: "It's okay! Charu――!"
P: 　I swallowed the words "I already knew you were a pervert" at the last moment.
P: 　Saying something like that would only make Charu feel worse.
P: 　Instead――.
P: "Even if you're a pervert, it's fine! In fact, I'm happy about it!"
P: 　I conveyed words that showed I accepted her.
P: 　I'm so embarrassed I could die.
P: "Y-you're happy about it? That's weird...! There's no way that's true...!"
P: 　Charu thought I was lying and didn't believe me.
P: 　Since we've never had this kind of conversation before, it's even harder for her to believe.
P: "It's true...! I'm a guy too! Of course I'd be happy if my girlfriend is open to perverted things...!"
P: 　I desperately tried to think of words that would make Charu understand.
P: 　Since I'm saying things on the spot, I might be saying something ridiculous――but it's not a lie.
P: "…………"
P: 　Perhaps sensing how desperate I was, Charu didn't argue back.
P: 　She fell silent, probably thinking about something.
P: 　Should I say something more――as I was thinking, the lock clicked open.
P: 　The door slowly opened, and Charu peeked out with half her face.
P: "Really...?"
P: 　It seems she came to check with her own eyes if I was lying.
P: "I wouldn't lie about something like this."
P: 　I held the doorknob to prevent her from running away and smiled at her.
P: "Even if I'm a pervert, it's okay...?"
P: 　I thought she would deny it, but Charu admitted that she's a pervert.
P: 　It's unfair to ask something like that while looking up at me.
P: 　As always, she knows how to play with a guy's heart.
P: "I welcome it, so come out."
P: 　I let go of the doorknob and moved to a position where Charu could see me, then spread my arms.
P: 　Then――.
P: "――!"
P: 　Charu's face lit up, and she came out of the room and hugged me.
P: 　I held her tightly and gently patted the back of her head.
P: "Mmm..."
P: 　Perhaps because she was hurt earlier, Charu relaxed her cheeks as if she felt relieved.
P: 　Then, she rubbed her face against my chest.
P: 　She's such a clingy and cute girl.
P: 　We moved to the sofa and spent the time spoiling the clingy Charu.
P: 　――Of course, the perverted stuff is reserved for tonight.
H1: Chapter 7　"The Beautiful Foreign Student and Christmas Eve"
P: 
P: 
P: After eating a slightly lighter dinner, taking into account the lessons from lunch, Charlotte sat on my lap and started acting sweet.
P: When Emma is around, it's her special seat, but when she's not, it might become Charlotte's special seat. Lately, she's been sitting on my lap more often.
P: Charlotte seems to like sitting on my lap.
P: "By the way, I heard there's a big doujinshi event in Tokyo at the end of the year. A lot of cosplayers will be there too. Do you want to go together? Since it's Tokyo, Akiba is also there, which Charlotte has been wanting to visit."
P: Remembering what she told me before, I invited Charlotte to a date in Tokyo.
P: There will be a lot of doujinshi that Charlotte loves, and we should be able to meet cosplayers, so I thought she would be happy.
P: But——.
P: "I can't take Emma to a place with so many people, and if we go to Tokyo for a day trip, we won't be able to see much... Let's not go..."
P: Unexpectedly, she declined.
P: I thought she would definitely be happy about it.
P: "Do you not like the idea of staying overnight...? Kaguraya-san is an adult, so she could come as a guardian..."
P: Instead, Kanon-san would also come along.
P: Since she has many friends in Tokyo, I think she would be happy to come.
P: "No, I would be very happy to stay overnight with you... But I can't make Emma feel lonely... That... I wouldn't be able to bear being apart from you for a few days..."
P: I understand that Emma has grown attached to me, and being apart for a few days might indeed be difficult.
P: Even if we take her to Tokyo, we can't bring her to the event, so someone would have to take care of her——and it would be difficult to ask Kanon-san or Kaguraya-san to do that.
P: Sophia-san probably can't come because of work.
P: "But it's a great opportunity...?"
P: This big event only happens twice a year, in summer and winter.
P: If we miss this one, the next one won't be for over half a year.
P: "I'm sorry you went through the trouble of looking it up for me. But honestly, I think it's dangerous given the attention from the video incident... So I... would like to go when we can stay overnight alone in the future."
P: Charlotte is right. Going while being noticed in a bad way might be reckless.
P: That's why Charlotte is saying there's no need to rush.
P: Being familiar with otaku culture, she probably knows about this event and that it will be held in the future as well.
P: This isn't the last one, so there's no need to rush.
P: "You're right, if we're staying overnight, it's better to be alone."
P: "Hehe, right?"
P: Charlotte smiled gently and pressed her face against my neck.
P: "More importantly... Should we go take a bath soon...?"
P: And then, she invited me first.
P: I had been wondering when to invite her after postponing it once, but Charlotte is quicker.
P: "Together... is that okay...?"
P: I was so nervous that my throat felt dry, but I checked just to be sure.
P: "Yes..."
P: Charlotte nodded with a red face.
P: It seems we're really going to take a bath together.
P: "Then, let's get our clothes..."
P: I had left some clothes in the dresser in the bedroom, so I took out some underwear and clothes from there.
P: When I returned to the living room——.
P: "Um, which one do you like better...?"
P: Charlotte was waiting, holding a Santa outfit in her right hand and a nurse outfit in her left.
P: No, well...
P: "That is...?"
P: "I thought I'd wear the one you like..."
P: It seems Charlotte is planning to cosplay even though it's our first time.
P: Why does this girl always go beyond my imagination...?
P: Is it because my knowledge is lacking...?
P: "I thought about a cat cosplay, but since it's the third time, maybe something new would be better... Since it's Christmas Eve, should I go with Santa?"
P: When I stayed silent, Charlotte asked again, looking embarrassed.
P: No, that's not it.
P: What's important isn't that.
P: "Charlotte, do you want to do it while wearing that?"
P: "Huh...!?"
P: When I asked, Charlotte looked very surprised.
P: As if she thought it was obvious.
P: "I thought guys loved cosplay... Do you not...?"
P: With a pale face, as if in despair, Charlotte trembled and asked.
P: Her eyes were teary, and she seemed to think she had messed up.
P: "N-no, that's not it...! I love seeing you in cosplay, but since it's our first time, I thought we should keep it normal...!"
P: I was supposed to build up the mood, but instead, I ruined it and hurriedly tried to fix things.
P: But——.
P: "Normal... I'm not normal..."
P: It seems I said something unnecessary, and Charlotte became even more depressed.
P: With a big moment coming up, I was also nervous, and my mind wasn't working well.
P: "Ah... um, well...! I-I mean, I thought it would be better to save the fun for later, and doing too much on the first time might not be good——I just thought we should keep it normal today...! I understand you want to cosplay, so don't worry...!"
P: I know I'm saying something ridiculous, but I'm trying my best to comfort Charlotte.
P: It seems my feelings got through, as Charlotte's expression brightened.
P: "Then, let's do round two here..."
P: "Round two!?"
P: How many times are we going to do this...!?
P: "Y-yeah, but there's no need to rush..."
P: I forced a smile and tried to fix things.
P: I'm aware that my stamina has dropped after the sports festival and ball games, so I'm not very confident.
P: "But, usually everyone is around, so it's difficult..."
P: Usually, Kanon-san and the others are at home.
P: More importantly, Emma is there, so it would be difficult to do such things.
P: But we have this room.
P: "If we come here, it should be fine..."
P: Still, I usually have to take care of Emma, and if I go out after she's asleep, Kanon-san and the others will notice, so it's still difficult.
P: 
P: "If we go out to play for an hour or two after school, and leave Emma with her mom, we could do it every day..."
P: 
P: Charlotte put her hand to her mouth and muttered something to herself.
P: If she's convincing herself, that's fine...
P: "That's right, there's no need to rush."
P: It seems she reached a conclusion, and she gave me a lovely smile.
P: I sighed in relief and took Charlotte's hand.
P: "Then, let's go..."
P: "Ah... yes..."
P: Holding hands seemed to have gotten her in the mood, and we headed to the bathroom.
P: Of course, Charlotte left her cosplay outfit in the room.
P: When we arrived at the changing room——.
P: "Should I have you undress me...?"
P: With a bright red face, Charlotte asked while covering her chest and looking up at me.
P: "Huh!?"
P: Of course, I was caught off guard and surprised.
P: I thought she would undress herself.
P: "Ah, um...! I-I read in a book that guys like to undress their partners in these situations, so I thought...!"
P: Because I was surprised, Charlotte's eyes darted around as she waved her hands and explained.
P: This was definitely my fault.
P: "Sorry, you're right... I think you're correct. Is it really okay...?"
P: While affirming Charlotte, I asked if it was okay to proceed.
P: "Ah, yes..."
P: Charlotte, who thought she wasn't wrong, calmed down and nodded while looking at me.
P: I held back my loud, almost bursting heartbeat and reached for the hem of Charlotte's top.
P: "Here I go...?"
P: "Yes..."
P: When I confirmed again, Charlotte nodded shyly and raised her hands.
P: I slowly lifted her top.
P: As I lifted it, her flawless white skin was revealed, and soon her small, cute belly button came into view.
P: Continuing to lift it, I saw a black lace bra.
P: I thought she would be wearing a white one, but it might be what's called a "battle underwear."
P: It suited Charlotte's pure white skin, and I almost couldn't help but stare.
P: But I held back and lifted it over Charlotte's head.
P: "…………"
P: After taking off her top, Charlotte immediately covered her bra with her hands.
P: She must still be embarrassed.
P: "Next is... the bottom... right...?"
P: But she actively tried to move forward.
P: It felt contradictory, but she must have both embarrassment and a desire to move forward.
P: "How do you take off a skirt...?"
P: I've never worn or taken off a skirt before, so I didn't know how to do it.
P: "Ah, there's a zipper here..."
P: Charlotte gently grabbed my hand and guided it to the zipper.
P: Careful not to catch the fabric or her skin, I carefully pulled down the zipper.
P: Then, the tight part loosened, and the skirt slid down.
P: "——!"
P: When her black panties came into view, Charlotte gasped and immediately covered them with her hands.
P: With her hands between her legs, it looked even more erotic.
P: "…………"
P: As I stared, Charlotte suddenly clasped her hands behind her back and spread her legs shoulder-width apart.
P: It looked like she was showing off her underwear to me.
P: "Charlotte...?"
P: "It's incredibly embarrassing... but since you're looking..."
P: It's not a lie that she's embarrassed.
P: Her pure white skin was now red all over her body.
P: Her eyes were tightly closed, and she seemed to be trying hard to endure the embarrassment.
P: Normally, I should quickly undress her and take her to the bathroom, but——her seductive appearance stopped my hands.
P: As I continued to stare, forgetting the time——.
P: "C-can we stop now...?"
P: Charlotte asked in a trembling voice.
P: It seemed she had reached her limit.
P: "Sorry, let's continue...!"
P: "Yes, please..."
P: When I apologized, Charlotte turned her back to me.
P: I had never touched a bra before, but the design made it easy to figure out how to unhook it, so I undid the clasp.
P: After removing the bra straps from her right shoulder, Charlotte immediately covered her chest with her hands.
P: "The bottom too, please..."
P: "Yeah..."
P: Prompted, I reached for Charlotte's panties.
P: Then, as I slowly pulled them down——a thread stretched from Charlotte's crotch to the panties.
P: It was obvious why that happened.
P: Charlotte must have been excited too.
P: Her small, cute butt was also visible, and I felt dizzy from excitement.
P: I was really about to lose my mind.
P: "Done——"
P: "I'll go ahead...!"
P: Right after I finished taking off her panties, Charlotte ran off to the bathroom.
P: It seems she was really pushing herself.
P: I was also so nervous that my heart felt like it was about to burst, so I took a deep breath to calm down.
P: The panties I was holding looked too pitiful to keep staring at, so I put them in the washing machine along with the bra.
P: "I'll undress myself..."
P: Since Charlotte had already gone to the bathroom and didn't say anything about wanting me to undress her, I took off my clothes myself.
P: After wrapping a towel around my waist, I entered the bathroom——.
P: "…………"
P: Charlotte was crouching in the corner.
P: She seemed to be trying hard to cover her chest and crotch.
P: "The towel is unfair..."
P: When Charlotte looked up and saw me, she pouted.
P: She was completely naked, while I had a towel wrapped around me, so she seemed dissatisfied.
P: "You ran away..."
P: "But I was embarrassed..."
P: I laughed awkwardly, and Charlotte stuck out her lips.
P: Her childish attitude made me want to smile.
P: But we couldn't stay like this forever...
P: "Which part should we wash first...?"
P: "Next, I'll go first..."
P: Charlotte said that and reached for my towel.
P: I thought she would wash her body first, but it seems she wants to wash my body first.
P: She must want to undress me quickly too.
P: "Okay, but start from the head——"
P: As I was saying that, Charlotte took the towel.
P: "——!!?"
P: And then, she was very surprised.
P: Or rather, she looked like she was losing color...
P: "N-no way... Is it really possible for something this big to fit...?"
P: Seeing her naked had already brought my excitement to its peak... In other words, the part Charlotte was looking at had gathered blood and become larger.
P: Seeing it for the first time, Charlotte seemed to be frozen in place.
P: That's strange, she should have knowledge about this too...?
P: "Charlotte...?"
P: "Ah, um... I'll wash your head first, so please sit on the bath chair..."
P: Charlotte, while avoiding eye contact, told me to sit down.
P: She seemed really shaken, but is she okay...?
P: I was worried, but I sat down as she instructed.
P: Then, I noticed Charlotte's reflection in the mirror as she moved behind me.
P: The mirror was always kept clean, and I had applied anti-fog treatment, so it was doing its job well.
P: Of course, Charlotte noticed it too, but she was cleverly hiding her body behind mine.
P: "Is there anywhere that itches...?"
P: "No, I'm fine..."
P: Charlotte carefully washed my head.
P: She seemed used to it, probably from washing Emma often.
P: After finishing washing my head——.
P: "…………"
P: She seemed to be staring at my back, lost in thought.
P: "Is something wrong...?"
P: I couldn't help but ask since she was staring so intently.
P: "Ah, no... I was just thinking about something..."
P: "Huh? What is it?"
P: "Well... there's a way to wash that guys usually like... but I was worried that if I did it, you might get scared off again..."
P: Perhaps because I had told her that it was okay for her to be a bit naughty, she didn't hesitate to mention her knowledge.
P: She probably learned it from a manga or something.
P: I was very interested, but if she did something too stimulating, I might not make it to the main event.
P: So, I decided to hold back——.
P: "I wouldn't get scared off, but let's save that for next time..."
P: I chose the safer option.
P: "Understood..."
P: Charlotte looked a bit disappointed but gently applied soap to the towel and started washing me.
P: I didn't resist and let her take care of me.
P: "I'm done with your back, so please turn around..."
P: After finishing my back, she asked me to face her.
P: When I did——Charlotte had stopped covering her body, and her private parts were now visible.
P: "Is this okay...?"
P: She had been trying so hard to cover herself earlier.
P: "You've already seen me, and you'll see more later... Besides, it's mutual..."
P: It seemed she had made up her mind while washing me.
P: Of course, my eyes were glued to her private parts.
P: "I'm so embarrassed I want to disappear... but I feel relieved..."
P: "Relieved about what...?"
P: "You never made a move on me before... so I was worried that you weren't interested in my body... But now that I see you're genuinely interested, I feel relieved..."
P: It seemed that holding back had made her anxious.
P: Ironically, trying to be considerate had hurt her instead.
P: Love really is complicated.
P: "Sorry, I was just holding back..."
P: "Please don't hold back... I'd be happier if you made a move on me..."
P: As she said this, Charlotte started washing my front with the towel.
P: After washing my chest, stomach, arms, and legs, she reached for my crotch.
P: "This part is delicate, so I'll wash it with my hands..."
P: Her gentle touch felt even more stimulating because it was someone else's hands.
P: But I couldn't let her see me in an embarrassing state, so I tried my best to endure.
P: "——Thank you. Now it's your turn..."
P: Since I was done, it was now Charlotte's turn to be washed.
P: Charlotte nodded shyly and handed me the shower.
P: "Is it okay if you stand?"
P: "...A-kun, you're so naughty..."
P: When I asked her to stand behind her, she seemed to have figured out what I was thinking.
P: Well, what can I do?
P: It's my first time in this kind of situation, so of course, I want to wash her while seeing her reflection in the mirror.
P: "Do you mind?"
P: "No, it's fine... If it makes you happy, I'll accept anything..."
P: What a strong and cute girl she is.
P: Thanks to her, I'm barely holding back my excitement.
P: "I'll start pouring water now."
P: I began pouring water over Charlotte's head.
P: "Mmm..."
P: As I slid the shower down her body, the water directly hit her chest, and Charlotte let out a small gasp.
P: I knew her ears were sensitive, but maybe her chest was too.
P: Then, as I continued sliding the shower down——.
P: "Ah...!"
P: When the water hit her crotch, Charlotte let out a high-pitched moan.
P: "Sorry, did it hurt...?"
P: I quickly moved the shower away.
P: "N-no... It's not that..."
P: Charlotte covered her mouth with her hand, avoiding eye contact and shaking her head slightly.
P: So it didn't hurt...?
P: For now, I continued pouring water over Charlotte's body.
P: After finishing washing her head, I applied soap directly to my hands instead of the towel.
P: "Aren't you going to use the towel...?"
P: Charlotte looked at me with heated eyes, her gaze meaningful.
P: Was she expecting something, or was I just reading too much into it?
P: "Yeah, is that okay...?"
P: "No, it's fine..."
P: With her permission, I placed my hands on Charlotte's neck.
P: "Fufu... Mmm... This tickles..."
P: As I slid my hands down her neck, Charlotte squirmed and spoke.
P: I wonder if she realizes how much her actions are exciting me...
P: "——Hyaa!?"
P: When my hands reached her chest and brushed against her nipples, her body jerked.
P: So, this part is sensitive too.
P: "Sorry, I'll wash you carefully."
P: "Y-yes... Mmm..."
P: Charlotte seemed to be trying not to make any noise, covering her mouth with her hand.
P: "Hyaa... Mmm... Fufu... Haah... Haah... Mmm..."
P: But it seemed she couldn't hold back her voice.
P: Her breathing had also become ragged, and I could tell she was enjoying it.
P: I was happy about that too, so I ended up focusing on washing Charlotte's chest.
P: Her chest was so soft, it was hard to believe it was a human body, and it had a great bounce too.
P: Her nipples were a beautiful pink, and the sense of superiority I felt from being able to touch them freely was overwhelming.
P: "A-A-kun... Haah... Haah... You're changing the purpose..."
P: But Charlotte's words brought me back to reality.
P: She was right; this was supposed to be about washing, and I shouldn't get ahead of myself.
P: "Sorry, I'll wash you properly."
P: With that, I carefully washed Charlotte's cute stomach.
P: Even just that made Charlotte's body tremble.
P: Could it be that her entire body is sensitive?
P: "Ah, um...! I'll wash that part myself...!"
P: As my hands moved lower, Charlotte suddenly grabbed my hand.
P: The embarrassment must have surged again as we got closer to that area.
P: "No, I washed you, so it's only fair."
P: "Hyaa!? D-don't talk near my ear...!"
P: I had whispered to her, but it seemed that was a bad idea since her ears were a weak point.
P: But in this situation, her reaction only fueled my excitement further.
P: While Charlotte was covering her ears, I reached for her crotch.
P: My hand brushed against something protruding, and it felt slippery——
P: "Mmm!?"
P: ——Charlotte's body jerked violently.
P: I might have gone too far.
P: "Charlotte...?"
P: Her reaction was so strong that I cautiously looked at her face.
P: "A-kun, you're being too mean... That part is sensitive, you know...?"
P: Her face was bright red, and she looked at me with teary, pouting eyes.
P: It seemed she thought I had done it on purpose.
P: So, this protruding part is what's called the clitoris...
P: I wanted to study more, but with Charlotte and Emma always around, I couldn't buy books, and I was afraid of stumbling upon weird stuff online, so I never gained much knowledge.
P: That's why I only knew as much as the guys who joked about dirty topics.
P: "Sorry, I didn't mean to..."
P: "Really...?"
P: "Yeah, I'll wash you gently..."
P: I apologized and touched her sensitive part again.
P: This area was even warmer, and it felt slippery.
P: I tried gently rubbing it with my hand, but it didn't seem to clean anything.
P: It was probably something coming from Charlotte herself, so that made sense.
P: Since it was an important area, I decided to wash it thoroughly.
P: Then——.
P: "Mmm... Haah... Haah... You're really... Haah... doing it on purpose..."
P: Charlotte leaned heavily against me.
P: "Are you okay...?"
P: "A-kun... you keep touching that spot... Fufu... My legs... can't move anymore..."
P: Her body was trembling, so I knew she was feeling it... but if I overstimulated her, she might lose strength...
P: I learned something new.
P: "You can lean on me if you need to..."
P: "No... I'm fine now... Please let me sit down..."
P: It seemed I had gone too far, so Charlotte sat down on the chair.
P: So I stopped touching her crotch and started washing her legs instead.
P: When I washed the soles of her feet and between her toes, Charlotte tried to pull her legs away, so her feet must be sensitive too.
P: Somehow... I realized that Charlotte's entire body was full of weak points, not just her ears.
P: After thoroughly washing her entire body with my hands, it was time to rinse off the soap——.
P: "By the way, Charlotte, earlier you said it didn't hurt when I washed your crotch, so why was it bad?"
P: I needed to rinse off the soap properly, so I had to pour water there too.
P: That's why I asked first.
P: "W-well, that's... because the stimulation is too strong..."
P: Charlotte answered while covering her mouth with her hand, avoiding eye contact.
P: I see, so that's how it is.
P: "I need to rinse off the soap, so can you stand up again?"
P: "Huh...? Ah, yes..."
P: Although she seemed confused, Charlotte obediently stood up.
P: I carefully poured water over Charlotte's body.
P: Then, when I poured water over her crotch again——.
P: "N-no...! A-kun, I said no...!"
P: Charlotte started panicking again.
P: If she slipped and fell, it would be dangerous, so I gently hugged her from behind, but I didn't stop pouring water.
P: "Why...!?"
P: Charlotte seemed surprised that I didn't stop, and she trembled as she asked.
P: "No, Charlotte? I have to rinse off the soap properly."
P: "Hyaa...! It's hitting...! The sensitive part... Mmm... It's hitting me...! Ahhh! Because you touched me earlier... Ugh... It's even more sensitive now...!"
P: It seemed that the stimulation felt even stronger than the first time.
P: But it didn't seem to hurt.
P: Charlotte was so cute as she struggled that I couldn't help but continue.
P: Charlotte tried to move her hips to avoid the water, but since I was holding her, there was only so much she could do.
P: On top of that, I could adjust the water's position by moving my hand, so Charlotte couldn't escape the stimulation.
P: Eventually——.
P: "N-no, I'm going to...!"
P: Charlotte's struggles became even more intense.
P: What does she mean by "going to"...?
P: Curious, I kept watching closely.
P: "No, no...! Not like this for my first time...! Mmm...!"
P: Charlotte started shaking her head vigorously.
P: "A-kun, please...! Not like this for my first time...!"
P: She didn't even have the energy to use polite language anymore, begging like a crying child.
P: Seeing Charlotte in such a state, I finally realized I had gone too far.
P: "Ahhh! No, no, no! I'm really going to——!"
P: "——Sorry, Charlotte...!"
P: The moment Charlotte tensed up, I quickly moved the shower away.
P: "……"
P: Without the stimulation, Charlotte rubbed her thighs together.
P: She seemed to be in a daze, breathing heavily.
P: "Are you okay...?"
P: Feeling guilty, I peeked at Charlotte's face to check on her.
P: "Haah... Haah... A-kun, you idiot... You're so mean..."
P: Charlotte looked at me with teary eyes, pouting like a child.
P: Seeing her like this, which I rarely did, made my heart race.
P: "Sorry... Um, are you okay...?"
P: "Ugh... I'm fine... I'm fine, but... this is also painful..."
P: What exactly is painful...?
P: With my lack of experience, I had no idea.
P: "…………"
P: Charlotte clung to me silently.
P: Was she asking for something?
P: "Um, should we get in the bath...?"
P: The water was already drawn, and since we had washed our bodies, it was normal to get in now.
P: But——Charlotte seemed to have other ideas.
P: "After teasing me like this... are you still going to push me further...?"
P: I must have misunderstood her, as she looked at me with a dissatisfied expression.
P: "Sorry, then let's dry off and go to bed...?"
P: If we weren't going to take a bath, the only option was to leave.
P: When I suggested that, Charlotte nodded slightly, so it seemed I had guessed correctly this time.
P: Charlotte dried herself off, wrapped a towel around her body, and went ahead.
P: Did I... make her angry...?
P: "Charlotte, are you mad...?"
P: When I entered the bedroom, Charlotte was sitting on the bed with just a towel, so I asked.
P: I definitely went too far, so if I made her angry, I needed to apologize properly.
P: But Charlotte shook her head.
P: "I just moved here before you could tease me more... For my first time, I want it to be in my boyfriend's bed..."
P: It seemed she had run away because she thought I would do something similar if she let me dry her.
P: "Can you turn off the lights...?"
P: Charlotte didn't want to do it with the lights on.
P: "If I turn them off completely, I won't be able to see anything, so is a dim light okay...?"
P: "That's fine..."
P: After confirming Charlotte's nod, I adjusted the lights to a dim setting.
P: "Come here..."
P: When the room was dim enough for us to barely see each other, Charlotte patted the spot behind her.
P: 
P: 　It seems she wanted me to come from behind, not the front.
P: "Is this okay...?"
P: "Yes, thank you..."
P: 　When I sat behind Charlotte, she leaned back against my chest.
P: 　Is this the position she wanted?
P: "Cha—mmph!?"
P: 　As I tried to call her name, Charlotte suddenly turned around and covered my mouth with hers.
P: 　With her own mouth.
P: "Mmm... nn... chu..."
P: 　As usual, Charlotte actively tangled her tongue with mine.
P: 　But she quickly pulled away.
P: 　It was the shortest French kiss we've had so far.
P: "Hehe... that's payback for teasing me earlier."
P: 　Charlotte smiled mischievously, like a little devil.
P: 　It was a smile I don't usually get to see.
P: "I didn't know you could make that kind of expression, Charlotte."
P: "Even I can be a little mean to A-kun sometimes."
P: 　Perhaps happy to have gotten her revenge, Charlotte spoke with a proud tone.
P: 　What is this?
P: 　She's just too cute.
P: 　I had feared our relationship might end after what happened in the bathroom, but it seems that worry was completely unfounded.
P: 　Well, I should probably still be careful not to overdo it.
P: "Please touch me... I was left hanging... my body is burning..."
P: 　Left hanging?
P: 　With that question in my mind, I reached out to her chest as Charlotte urged.
P: 　Charlotte leaned her back against me again, showing no signs of resistance.
P: 　Since I made her suffer earlier, I decided to focus only on making her feel good this time.
P: 　――That said, I have almost no technique or knowledge on how to make her feel good.
P: 　In terms of knowledge alone, I probably can't even compare to Charlotte.
P: 　But I can learn.
P: 　I decided to observe Charlotte, learn how to touch her, where she feels good, and study her reactions.
P: 　I tried lightly touching her nipple, the most sensitive part of her chest, with my finger.
P: "――"
P: 　Charlotte's body twitched in response, but she didn't make a sound.
P: "Are you holding back your voice?"
P: "It's embarrassing... if you hear it..."
P: 　This time, as I gently rubbed her nipple, a small sigh escaped Charlotte's lips.
P: 　Since she's holding back, maybe if I make her talk, it'll be easier for her to let it out.
P: 　I continued to fondle her chest, lifting it from below and rubbing it in various ways, observing Charlotte's reactions.
P: 　Among the things I tried, the one that got the biggest reaction from her was――
P: "Nnngh!"
P: 　――When I gently scratched her nipple with my fingernail.
P: "Do you like this?"
P: "Th-that kind of thing... nngh... you shouldn't ask... nnnn..."
P: 　Her reaction was good, so she must like it.
P: 　Even so, the fact that she reacts so strongly to just her chest means she's really sensitive.
P: 　But just because she's feeling good doesn't mean I should get carried away, or I'll end up making the same mistake as before.
P: 　I decided to proceed carefully and gently, without overdoing it.
P: 　I continued to stimulate only Charlotte's chest.
P: 　Of course, I tried the scratching that got a big reaction from her, but I also tried other things, like tracing her areola without touching her nipple, or pinching and stroking just her nipple.
P: 　The common thread was that I didn't do anything too rough to avoid hurting Charlotte.
P: 　As I continued to focus on her chest――.
P: "This... feels weird..."
P: 　Charlotte muttered something while squirming, her hands between her thighs.
P: "Huh? Did you say something?"
P: 　Focused only on her chest and reactions, I didn't catch what she said, so I asked.
P: "Ugh... A-kun, you're so mean..."
P: 　But for some reason, Charlotte looked at me with teary eyes.
P: 　I don't think I was being mean...?
P: 　If anything, I was trying to be gentle...
P: "Men like to make girls say things like this, just like it said in the book..."
P: 　Charlotte seemed to be misunderstanding something, and after turning to me, she looked down shyly.
P: 　I did ask because I didn't hear her, but I wasn't trying to force her to say anything... right?
P: 　As I hesitated, Charlotte looked up at me with a pained expression and spoke with upturned eyes.
P: "Please... don't tease me... My head is going crazy..."
P: "――っ!?"
P: 　Suddenly being begged like that, my mind went blank.
P: 　Charlotte... you're too erotic...
P: "I didn't mean to tease you..."
P: "Please... touch me here too..."
P: 　Charlotte got on her knees, pinched the bath towel, and lifted it from below.
P: 　With that, her hidden parts were revealed――and a watery substance was dripping from her crotch to her thighs.
P: 　Drops were also falling onto the futon――it was clear just how aroused Charlotte was.
P: "Is this okay...?"
P: "If you tease me any more... I'll go crazy..."
P: 　What happened in the bathroom must have been hard for Charlotte, but not being able to touch her crotch and only having her chest touched must have been tough too.
P: 　Sex is really difficult...
P: 　I knew I should touch her crotch, but what should I do...?
P: 　Her clitoris――she didn't like it in the shower, so maybe I should avoid it for now.
P: 　Then, should I use my fingers...?
P: 　I didn't know the right answer, but I thought Charlotte would stop me if she didn't like it, so I pressed my middle finger against her private parts.
P: 　As I searched for something like a hole, Charlotte's body trembled, and she covered her mouth with her hand, as if the stimulation was too strong.
P: "Found it, should I go in?"
P: "Y-yes..."
P: 　Once I found the hole, Charlotte tightly closed her eyes and nodded.
P: 　Since I hadn't inserted my finger yet, she must be holding back her voice and pleasure, not pain.
P: 　I think Charlotte has a hymen, so it's probably better not to insert my finger too deeply.
P: 　I carefully inserted my finger.
P: 　It wouldn't go in unless I pushed, and once it was in, it felt like it was being squeezed tightly from both sides, as if by walls.
P: 　The temperature was also very high, almost like it could burn――though not quite that hot.
P: 　So this is what it's like inside a vagina...
P: "Is it okay if I move?"
P: 　Since I can't tell how Charlotte feels, I have to ask like this.
P: 　Charlotte kept her eyes closed and nodded vigorously.
P: 　Then, as I slowly moved my finger in and out――.
P: "Nngh... fuu..."
P: 　Charlotte's breath began to escape her lips again.
P: 　But for someone as sensitive as her, the reaction wasn't as big as I expected.
P: 　Maybe just moving in and out isn't enough...?
P: 　Thinking that, I pressed the pad of my finger against the upper wall of her flesh and gently rubbed it back and forth.
P: "Nnngh!?"
P: 　Then, Charlotte reacted noticeably.
P: 　I see, so this is what she likes.
P: "I'll do it slowly, so don't worry."
P: 　If I do it too hard, it might hurt, so I gently rubbed inside.
P: 　Even so, the stimulation must have been strong, as Charlotte, who had been on her knees, fell onto me.
P: "S-sorry... let me change positions..."
P: 　It seemed she couldn't handle being on her knees, so I had to pull my finger out for a moment.
P: 　Then, after Charlotte sat back down, leaning her back against my chest, she gave me permission to continue.
P: "Should I do this side too?"
P: "――っ!?　Y-you mean my chest too...!?"
P: 　As I gently stroked inside Charlotte's vagina with my right middle finger, I used my left hand to scratch her left nipple, and Charlotte shook her head from side to side.
P: "This is no good..."
P: "…………"
P: 　When I stopped, Charlotte looked at me with a pained expression.
P: 　Huh...?
P: 　In this case, even if she says no, should I keep going...?
P: 　Thinking that, I attacked both again, and Charlotte tightly grabbed my arm with her hand.
P: 　But she didn't say "No."
P: 　It seems this isn't a no after all.
P: 　This is really too difficult...
P: 　Not knowing how to proceed, I was confused by Charlotte's reactions, but I continued to search for the spot that felt good with my right hand.
P: 　Eventually, my finger touched a rough area.
P: 　Why is this part so rough?
P: 　Feeling something different, I focused on rubbing that spot.
P: 　As a result――.
P: "N-no...! Not there...!"
P: 　Charlotte started to panic again.
P: 　In this case, does "no" mean stop or keep going...?
P: "Did it hurt...?"
P: 　Just in case, I stopped and asked if it hurt.
P: 　If it did, I would stop immediately.
P: "No, it's just... that's a particularly sensitive spot for girls..."
P: 　It seems it's too sensitive, so it's a no.
P: 　But how does Charlotte know that?
P: 　If it's something you can tell by touching, like me, but can she tell just by being touched?
P: 　I understand that the stimulation is too strong――but that might just be Charlotte.
P: 　That question was answered by a certain confession from Charlotte.
P: "――The stimulation is... hii... too strong... Why... nngh... does it feel so good... with A-kun...? When I do it myself... ahh... it's not like this..."
P: 　It was when I was rubbing or gently tapping the rough spot Charlotte had said was a no.
P: 　She muttered that to herself.
P: "...Charlotte, do you do it yourself?"
P: "Huh!?"
P: 　When I asked without thinking, Charlotte turned to me in surprise.
P: "Did I say something...!?"
P: 　It seems she didn't realize she had muttered it.
P: 　Was she so focused on holding back the stimulation that her thinking ability had declined?
P: "You said something like, 'When I do it myself, it's not like this...' right?"
P: "!"
P: 　So she did say it.
P: 　Charlotte covered her face with both hands and started writhing, shaking her head from side to side.
P: "N-no, that's not it...! I'm not such a perverted girl that I do it multiple times a day...!"
P: 　Wait, does that mean she does it every day!?
P: 　The content of her excuse was about how many times a day she does it, so I couldn't help but come to that conclusion.
P: 　I had thought she might have a strong sex drive, but I never imagined it was this much...
P: 　But when does she even do it...?
P: 　I haven't had the time to study up on sexual activities...
P: 　Ah... that time I woke up late at night, Charlotte was rustling under the futon, so maybe she secretly gets up after I fall asleep and does it...?
P: "Ugh... why do I have to be the one to suffer such humiliation...?"
P: 　As I was thinking, Charlotte looked like she was about to cry.
P: 　It must have been a shock for me to find out.
P: 　The reason Charlotte is the one suffering humiliation is because she keeps digging her own grave... but I can't say that, can I...?
P: "It's okay... I told you, I welcome a perverted Charlotte."
P: 　Feeling sorry for her, I gently hugged Charlotte and stroked her head with my left hand.
P: 　I was surprised to hear it was every day, but I think there are girls like that, and it's not something to blame her for.
P: 　As long as her feelings are directed only at me, as she said, I welcome it.
P: "A-kun... can you kiss me...?"
P: 　Perhaps because I hugged and stroked her head, Charlotte calmed down and asked for a kiss.
P: 　I obliged, tangling our tongues until we were out of breath.
P: 　Then, after pulling away――.
P: "Please... I can't hold back anymore... Please do it hard..."
P: 　Charlotte lay down on the futon, spread her legs, and begged.
P: 　Charlotte was most disheveled in the bathroom, so she probably hasn't been stimulated that much yet.
P: "Is it okay to do it hard...?"
P: "Yes... what happened in the bathroom was my first time, and I just didn't like the shower..."
P: 　Now that she mentioned it, she did say something like, "It's my first time, but I don't like this..."
P: 　If that's the case, I won't hold back either.
P: 　That said, doing it too hard might hurt, so I carefully rubbed the rough spot again, being careful not to overdo it.
P: 　Then, perhaps because I had teased her so much――.
P: "Ahhh! Your finger, it's so intense...! My... kuun... it feels so good, keep rubbing it...!"
P: 　Charlotte arched her back violently.
P: "I-I'm going to cum...! I'm going to cum right away...! Ahhh, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming!"
P: 　She screamed obscene words.
P: "I'm cumminggggggggg!"
P: 　She reached climax almost immediately.
P: 　It was a side of her that I had never seen before, usually so graceful and elegant.
P: 　Seeing her so disheveled, no man could help but get excited.
P: "Haah... haah..."
P: 　Drenched in sweat, Charlotte lay on the futon, staring blankly at the ceiling.
P: 　I wanted to see her even more disheveled.
P: 　Thinking that, I moved my finger again――.
P: "W-wait...! Right after cumming, I'm too sensitive, so don't move...!"
P: 　The stimulation must have been too strong, as Charlotte came to her senses and frantically stopped me.
P: 　After seeing her so disheveled, I felt like moving my finger on purpose, but――since what happened in the bathroom is still fresh, I decided to obediently stop for today.
P: 　It's not over yet, after all.
P: "Did it feel good?"
P: 　I pulled out my finger and peered into Charlotte's face.
P: 　Then, Charlotte took the futon and covered her face up to her mouth, giving me a sidelong glance.
P: "You shouldn't ask things like that... A-kun, you're teasing me on purpose, aren't you...?"
P: "Huh...? I just wanted to hear it from you..."
P: "Ugh... it felt good... I wouldn't have reacted like that if it didn't..."
P: 　Since I said I wanted to hear it, Charlotte reluctantly answered, though she acted sulky.
P: 　I love the usual graceful Charlotte, but this sulky, childish side of her is also incredibly cute.
P: 　I'm really lucky to be dating Charlotte.
P: "Should we take a little break?"
P: 　I'm still energetic, but Charlotte looks exhausted from what happened in the bathroom.
P: 　We still have plenty of time, so it's better to let her rest slowly without rushing.
P: 　But――.
P: "I'm fine, so please continue..."
P: 　Charlotte wanted to keep going.
P: "Thank you. Then――"
P: 　I was about to say that when a bad thought crossed my mind, and I froze.
P: 　We're about to become one, but――I didn't buy any condoms...
P: 　I was so preoccupied with today's events that I forgot about the essential condoms.
P: 　Wait, no way...?
P: 　After coming this far, am I going to be left hanging...?
P: 　This is the level where Charlotte would be disappointed in me, right...?
P: "...A-kun, you didn't prepare any condoms, did you...?"
P: 　As I was sweating profusely, Charlotte seemed to have noticed.
P: 　At times like this, her sharp intuition is a pain.
P: "No, um... sorry!!"
P: 　I bowed my head deeply.
P: 　I never thought I'd make such a mistake.
P: 　I really messed up, what should I do...!
P: 　But――instead of getting angry, Charlotte chuckled and smiled.
P: "Huh...?"
P: "Ah, sorry... I just thought it was funny that even A-kun makes mistakes like this... Until now, A-kun seemed so perfect, so I'm a little happy."
P: 　Why is she happy about this...?
P: 　I don't understand Charlotte's feelings at all...
P: "Don't worry, I have some..."
P: 　Charlotte said that, then covered herself with the bath towel and headed to the living room.
P: 　When she returned, she was holding a box of condoms――
P: "Why do you have those!?"
P: 　――I couldn't help but ask.
P: "Well... I bought them a while ago... and hid them..."
P: 　It seems she had hidden them somewhere in the living room.
P: 　She's been preparing for this for a while... I really can't compete with Charlotte in this area.
P: "That's a relief... thank you."
P: 　I thanked her and reached out to take the condoms from Charlotte.
P: 　But――Charlotte pulled her hand back.
P: "Um...?"
P: 　Not understanding her intention, I tilted my head.
P: "Are you really going to wear this?"
P: 　Charlotte smiled mischievously, like a little devil, and tilted her head as she asked.
P: "What do you mean...?"
P: "It's my first time... so for the sake of memories, we don't have to use one...?"
P: 　It seems Charlotte doesn't want me to wear a condom.
P: 　I never expected a girl to say something like this.
P: "If something goes wrong, we could end up with a child..."
P: "I'd want a child with A-kun right now... But... it would cause trouble for others, wouldn't it...?"
P: 　Charlotte smiled sadly as she said that.
P: 　If we had a child, it would cause trouble for Sophia-san and Kanon-san, and it would betray their trust.
P: 　That must never happen.
P: 　Charlotte knows that too, which is why she asked.
P: "It's a tempting offer, but sorry. I can't agree to that."
P: "Hehe... I knew you'd say that, A-kun. I'm sorry for asking such a mean question."
P: 　I understand Charlotte's feelings.
P: 　It's my first time too, so it would be more memorable, and doing it raw for the first time would be amazing.
P: 　But we have to draw the line somewhere.
P: 　If something were to happen, I'm not in a position to take responsibility yet.
P: "I'm really happy you feel that way... thank you."
P: "Just hearing you say that makes me happy too. So... even if it's not raw, will you let me put it on for you...?"
P: 　She probably wants this to be part of the memory too.
P: 　Charlotte looked up at me with upturned eyes as she asked.
P: "Yeah, of course. Thank you."
P: "Ah... yes!"
P: 　When I nodded, Charlotte happily opened the condom packet.
P: 　Then, she carefully placed it on my penis.
P: 　Condoms are really tight...
P: "I'm nervous..."
P: 　Charlotte, lying on the futon with her back against it, spread her legs and tightly clenched her hands in front of her chest.
P: 　I've heard the first time is painful, so she must be scared.
P: "I'll wait until you're ready."
P: 　In this case, the man only feels good, while the woman feels pain.
P: 　So it's better to let Charlotte decide when to go.
P: "No, I'm ready anytime... I've already made up my mind..."
P: 　It seems my concern was unnecessary.
P: "Okay, then here I go."
P: 　I intertwined my fingers with Charlotte's and pressed them against the futon, connecting us as lovers.
P: 　With nothing covering her chest, Charlotte shyly averted her eyes, but I looked down at her cute face as I slowly pressed my penis against her private parts.
P: "――Ouch...!"
P: 　As I entered a little, Charlotte's face twisted in pain.
P: "Should I stop...?"
P: "N-no, it's okay... Please keep going..."
P: 　She was clearly forcing herself, but I couldn't disregard her resolve.
P: 　As I continued, I felt a slight resistance.
P: 　This must be the hymen I've heard about.
P: 　From the sensation, it doesn't seem to be blocking the entire vagina.
P: "I think it'll hurt less if I go in quickly, so I'll push in hard, okay?"
P: "Yes, please..."
P: 　After confirming Charlotte's nod, I thrust my hips in hard, pushing through.
P: "!"
P: 　It must have hurt a lot.
P: 　Charlotte stifled her voice, but let out something close to a scream.
P: 　Fresh blood came out of her vagina, showing just how much it hurt.
P: 　In contrast, I was feeling an intense pleasure, so I felt terrible for Charlotte.
P: "Sorry, it hurt, didn't it...?"
P: 　Tears were streaming from Charlotte's eyes, so I gently wiped them away with my finger.
P: 　Then, Charlotte smiled softly.
P: "It hurts... but I'm happier... Because I gave my first time to someone I love..."
P: 　Really, this girl...
P: 　My girlfriend might have a strong sex drive and be quite perverted, but she's also incredibly cute, graceful, and kind.
P: 　No matter how much hardship or pain I face, I'll stay by her side for the rest of my life.
P: 　And I want to protect this wonderful smile forever.
P: "A-kun... can you kiss me...?"
P: "Of course."
P: 　I didn't move right away, but instead kissed Charlotte until her pain subsided.
H1: Epilogue
P: 
P: 
P: "A-kun, A-kun♪"
P: 　Currently, I and Charlotte are hugging each other naked.
P: 　After finishing our intimate act, we took a bath together and then got into the futon.
P: 　Perhaps because she was so happy about our connection, Charlotte has been in a great mood and has been clinging to me.
P: 　She’s been rubbing her face against my chest, looking very happy.
P: "I'm sorry, in the end, I couldn't hold back..."
P: 　Recalling what happened during the act, I apologized while stroking Charlotte's head.
P: 　Her insides felt too good, and after she got used to the pain, she started to feel pleasure. When I touched the spot that made her react strongly, she became so wild that I couldn't hold back anymore.
P: 　Normally, the pain of losing one's virginity wouldn't go away so quickly, but Charlotte's body is amazing.
P: "Please don't apologize. I was so happy that you wanted me so desperately. And... well, it was intense... but it felt good because you focused on my weak spots..."
P: 　Charlotte answered with heated eyes before burying her face in my chest.
P: 　Her shyness is just too cute.
P: "Did it really not hurt?"
P: "It only hurt at the beginning... Otherwise, I wouldn't have been like that..."
P: 　Charlotte must have been recalling what happened too.
P: 　As if to hide her embarrassment, she pressed her face against me.
P: 　She must be really embarrassed since she asked for it so many times.
P: "――っ!?"
P: 　Of course, when she reacts so cutely, my lower half can't help but respond... and Charlotte, who was pressed against me, noticed immediately.
P: 　It’s touching her stomach area, so it’s only natural.
P: "…………"
P: 　Being stared at with those pure eyes, I felt guilty.
P: 　Before we started, Charlotte mentioned a second round, but it’s too soon after her first time to push her.
P: 　If I leave it alone, it’ll calm down soon.
P: 　After all, I’ve already been drained multiple times.
P: 　But――.
P: "Um... since it’s my first time, I can’t handle it inside again today... Should I use my mouth...?"
P: 　Unexpectedly, Charlotte actively reached out.
P: 　She probably feels the same way about not wanting to push herself too hard on her first time.
P: 　Still, I didn’t expect her to suggest using her mouth.
P: 　She doesn’t have to go that far.
P: "It’s okay, it’ll go away if I leave it alone. You don’t have to push yourself, Charlotte."
P: "Is that so..."
P: 　Huh?
P: 　Does she look a little disappointed, or is it just my imagination...?
P: 　Jiririririri!
P: "「――っ!?」"
P: 　Suddenly, an alarm rang out, and both Charlotte and I flinched.
P: 　It was so loud in the quiet space that we were genuinely startled.
P: 　But――the fact that the alarm I set went off means the date has changed.
P: "Sorry, just wait a moment."
P: 　I got out of the futon and retrieved something I had brought with me after getting out of the bath.
P: "Charlotte, can you give me your left hand?"
P: "...?"
P: 　When I asked, Charlotte tilted her head curiously but extended her left hand to me.
P: 　I placed the gift on her left ring finger and――
P: "Happy birthday."
P: 　――celebrated her birthday.
P: "Th-this is...!?"
P: 　Charlotte looked surprised, alternating between looking at her left hand and my face.
P: 　She probably didn’t expect a birthday present like this.
P: "You might think it’s too soon since we’re still students, but since we’re engaged, it’s an engagement ring."
P: 　Yes, this is what I wanted to give her.
P: 　I thought that giving her an engagement ring would ease her anxiety about someone taking me away and her tendency to get jealous of other girls.
P: "This must have been expensive... right?"
P: "Ahaha... sorry, I wish I could have bought something more expensive to make it more impressive... but I could only afford about half of what adults usually spend on engagement rings."
P: 
P: 　Thinking that Charlotte might hesitate if I mentioned the specific amount, I kept it vague and glossed over it.
P: "Would you have preferred a different present?"
P: "That's not true at all... Because I... I'm so happy that I could cry..."
P: 　As she said this, tears really did start flowing from Charlotte's eyes.
P: 　I was genuinely relieved that my thoughtless idea didn't end in disaster.
P: "I'm glad you're happy with it."
P: "There's no way I wouldn't be happy to receive an engagement ring... Thank you so much for such a wonderful gift... I'll treasure it for the rest of my life..."
P: 　Charlotte gently caressed the ring with her hand.
P: 　Her expression seemed filled with happiness.
P: "A-kun..."
P: 　Charlotte moved behind me and hugged me around the neck.
P: 　A soft, warm sensation immediately spread across my back.
P: "Hmm?"
P: "Today's birthday is... the happiest day of my life since I was born... Thank you so much..."
P: 　It seemed she really liked the gift, as Charlotte rubbed her cheek against mine.
P: "I feel the same way. I'm really happy right now."
P: 　It was only natural, since I had connected with the girl I love.
P: 　It would surely become a lifelong memory.
P: "Meeting A-kun... and becoming your girlfriend... I truly feel from the bottom of my heart that it was the best thing that ever happened... Please stay with me for the rest of my life... I will give you everything I have..."
P: "I'm the one who wants to ask you. Let's stay together from now on, okay?"
P: 　I placed my left hand over Charlotte's left hand.
P: 　Perhaps sensing my feelings, Charlotte let out a happy giggle——
P: "Yes, we'll be together forever. Even if A-kun says he doesn't want to, I won't let you go."
P: 　——and then she hugged me tightly.
P: 
P: 　By the way, after that, Charlotte, who was overwhelmed with emotion, ended up pushing me down, and before I knew it, round two had begun...
H1: Afterword
P: 
P: 
P: 
P: 
P: First of all, thank you for picking up Volume 6 of "The Girl Next Door."
P: Also, to everyone who was involved in the production of Volume 6, thank you so much for your continued support.
P: Thanks to all of you, I was able to release Volume 6.
P: As always, I am filled with nothing but gratitude...!
P: ...How should I put it... I feel like Volume 6 came out quickly, but at the same time, I also feel like it took a long time to get here.
P: It's been over two years since Volume 1 was released.
P: Time really flies.
P: I am truly grateful to be able to continue this series.
P: It's all thanks to the production team who have supported me and the readers who have purchased this work.
P: Thank you so much.
P: ...As I was saying that, it suddenly occurred to me.
P: Two years since the release?
P: That means... it's been nearly four and a half years since I first wrote "The Girl Next Door" as a web novel. (laughs)
P: When I think about it that way, it's been quite a long time.
P: And time really does fly.
P: Originally, this was my second work after I got serious about writing light novels, so among the works I've written online, this is one of the oldest.
P: It was the work I wrote online right after my debut work, "Bochi Ota," but since I had only written two or three works online before "Bochi Ota," this is really one of the oldest.
P: I am very happy that such a work has been able to see the light of day commercially and become a long-running series, and I am deeply moved.
P: I secretly hope that it will be adapted into an anime someday... (laughs)
P: (Well, I've been openly saying on social media, "I want it to be adapted into an anime...!" so it's not really a secret.)
P: Also, personally, I am thinking of ways to make the most of this work and bring joy to the readers who have come to love "The Girl Next Door," so I hope I can make that happen.
P: The plan is only in my head for now. (laughs)
P: I also really love the world of "The Girl Next Door," and of course, I love Charlotte and Akihito, as well as Emma and all the other characters, so I want the readers to enjoy it even more.
P: Now, I would like to touch on the content of this volume, but honestly, I didn't think I would be able to write the scenes in the latter part of the story.
P: I just wrote what I wanted to write, thinking that if there were any bad parts, I would get feedback and fix them.
P: But... most of it went through as is, with only a few issues with the expressions, so I was surprised.
P: And I was also happy.
P: I was able to write what I had envisioned, so of course, I was happy.
P: There might not be many romance-comedy works that go this far.
P: I do know of some works that include such scenes, but it's still quite a difficult thing to do.
P: I hope you can think of it as just a bit of spice in this work.
P: The main focus of the story is still on the sweet moments between Akihito and Charlotte, the cuteness of the spoiled Emma, and the resolution of the problems they face, so I hope you can enjoy those aspects.
P: It's just that, as an extension of their sweet moments, such things might happen occasionally.
P: ...Charlotte loves Akihito so much that such developments might increase. (laughs)
P: Akihito's rationality might get in the way, but can he really resist Charlotte's cute pleading...? (laughs)
P: A new character also appeared in this volume, so I hope you look forward to the next volume!
P: (If I can release the next volume...!)
P: --So, I hope we can meet again in the next volume!
P: Once again, thank you so much for picking up Volume 6 of "The Girl Next Door"!
P: Let's meet again in the next volume, bye-bye!
